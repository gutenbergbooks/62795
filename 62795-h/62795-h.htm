<p>The Author begs leave to observe, in
explanation of the use made of the plural
term in the following pages, that, her journey
having been performed in the company
of her nearest relative and friend, the account
of it has been written so much from
their mutual observation, that there would
be a deception in permitting the book to
appear, without some acknowledgement,
which may distinguish it from works entirely
her own. The title page would,
therefore, have contained the joint names
of her husband and herself, if this mode of
appearing before the Public, besides being
thought by that relative a greater acknowledgement
than was due to his share of the
work, had not seemed liable to the imputation
of a design to attract attention by
extraordinary novelty. It is, however, necessary
to her own satisfaction, that some
notice should be taken of this assistance.
She may, therefore, be permitted to intrude
a few more words, as to this subject, by
saying, that where the &oelig;conomical and political
conditions of countries are touched
upon in the following work, the remarks
are less her own than elsewhere.</p>

<p>With respect to the book itself, it is, of
course, impossible, and would be degrading
if it were not so, to prevent just censure
by apologies; and unjust censure she has
no reason, from her experience, to fear;&mdash;but
she will venture to defend a practice
adopted in the following pages, that has
been sometimes blamed for its apparent nationality,
by writers of the most respectable
authority. The references to England,
which frequently occur during the foreign
part of the tour, are made because it has
seemed that one of the best modes of describing
to any class of readers what they
may not know, is by comparing it with
what they do.</p>

<h3><a name="HELVOETSLUYS" id="HELVOETSLUYS">HELVOETSLUYS.</a></h3>

<p>About twenty hours after our embarkation,
at Harwich, and six after our
first sight of the low-spread and barren
coast of <i><ins title="modern spelling is Goeree">Goree</ins></i>, we reached this place,
which is seated on one of many inlets, that
carry the waters of the German Ocean
through the southern part of the province
of Holland. <i>Goree</i>, rendered an island by
these encroachments of the sea, is always
the first land expected by the seamen; or
rather they look out for the lofty tower of
its church, which, though several miles
more distant than the shore, is visible when
that cannot be discerned. The entrance of
the water between the land, in a channel
probably three leagues wide, soon after
commences; and Helvoetsluys is then presently
seen, with the masts of vessels rising
above its low houses, amidst green embankments
and pastures, that there begin to
reward the care of excluding the sea.</p>

<p>The names of Dutch towns are in themselves
expressive of the objects most interesting
to a people, who, for opportunities of
commerce, have increased their original and
natural dangers, by admitting the water in
some parts, while, for their homes and their
lives, they must prevent it from encroaching
upon others. <i>Dam</i>, <i>Sluice</i>, or <i>Dyke</i> occur
in almost all their compounded titles. The
sluice, which gives this town part of its name,
is also its harbour; affording, perhaps, an
outlet to the overflowings of the country
behind, but filled at the entrance to the depth
of more than eighty feet by the sea, with
which it communicates.</p>

<p>Upon the banks of this sluice, which are
partly artificial, the town is built in one short
street of small houses, inhabited chiefly by
tradesmen and innkeepers. The dockyard
bounds the sluice and the town, communicating
with the former by gates, over which
a small pivot bridge connects the two sides
of the street. Each head of the pier, or harbour,
has been extended beyond the land, for
several yards by pile work, filled with earth
and large stones, over which there is no
pavement, that its condition may be constantly
known. We stepped from the packet
upon one of these, and, walking along the
beams, that pass between the immense piles,
saw how closely the <i>interstices</i> were filled,
and how the earth and stones were again
compacted by a strong kind of basket-work.</p>

<p>The arrival of a packet is the chief incident
known at Helvoetsluys, and, as ours
entered the harbour about noon, and in fine
weather, perhaps, a fourth part of the inhabitants
were collected as spectators. Their
appearance did not surprise us with all the
novelty, which we had expected from the
first sight of a foreign people. The Dutch
seamen every where retain the national dress;
but the other men of Helvoetsluys differ
from Englishmen in their appearance chiefly
by wearing coarser clothes, and by bringing
their pipes with them into the street. Further
on, several women were collected about
their baskets of herbs, and their dress had
some of the novelty, for which we were
looking; they had hats of the size of a small
chinese umbrella, and almost as gaudily lined
within; close, white jackets, with long flaps;
short, coloured petticoats, in the shape of a
diving bell; yellow slippers, without quarters
at the heel; and caps, that exactly fitted
the head and concealed the hair, but which
were ornamented at the temples by gold
filagree clasps, twirling, like vine tendrils,
over the cheeks of the wearer.</p>

<p>Our inn was kept by English people, but
the furniture was entirely Dutch. Two
beds, like cribs in a ship, were let into the
wainscot; and we were told, that, in all the
inns on our journey, we should seldom, or
never, be shewn into a room, which had not
a bed.</p>

<p>Helvoetsluys, it sufficiently appears, is a
very inconsiderable place, as to its size and
inhabitants. But it is not so in naval, or military
estimation. It is distant about ten or
twelve miles from the open sea, yet is nearly
secure from attack on this side, because that
part of the approach, which is deep enough
for large vessels, is commanded by batteries
on shore. It stands in the middle of an immense
bay, large enough to contain all the
navy of Holland, and has a dockyard and
arsenal in the centre of the fortifications.
When we passed through it, six ships of
the line and two frigates were lying in
the dockyard, and two ships of the line and
three frigates, under the command of an
Admiral, in the bay.</p>

<p>The fortifications, we were assured upon
good military authority, were in such repair,
that not a sod was out of its place,
and are strong enough to be defended by five
thousand men against an hundred thousand,
for five weeks. The sea water rises to a considerable
height in a wide ditch, which surrounds
them. We omitted to copy an inscription,
placed on one of the walls, which
told the date of their completion; but this
was probably about the year 1696, when
the harbour was perfected. Though the
dockyard can be only one of the dependencies
upon that of Rotterdam, the largest ships
of that jurisdiction are preserved here, on account
of the convenient communication between
the port and the sea.</p>

<p>Near this place may be observed, what
we examined with more leisure upon our
return, the ingenuity, utility and vastness of
the embankments, opposed by the Dutch to
the sea. From Helvoetsluys eastward, for
many miles, the land is preserved from the
sea only by an artificial mound of earth,
against which the water heavily and often
impetuously strives for admission into the
sheltered plains below. The sea, at high
water, is so much above the level of the
ground, from which it is thus boldly separated,
that one who stands on the land side
of the embankment hears the water foaming,
as if over his head. Yet the mound
itself, which has stood for two centuries, at
least, without repair, though with many renewals
of the means, that protect it, is still
unhurt and undiminished, and may yet see
generations of those, whom it defends, rising
and passing away, on one side, like the fluctuations
of the tides, which assail and retire
from it, on the other.</p>

<p>It is better, however, to describe than
to praise. The mound, which appears to
be throughout of the same height, as to the
sea, is sometimes more and sometimes less
raised above the fields; for, where the natural
level of the land assists in resistance to
the water, the Hollanders have, of course,
availed themselves of it, to exert the less of
their art and their labour. It is, perhaps,
for the most part, thirty feet above the adjoining
land. The width at top is enough to
permit the passage of two carriages, and
there is a sort of imperfect road along it.
In its descent, the breadth increases so much,
that it is not very difficult to walk down
either side. We could not measure it, and
may therefore be excused for relating how
its size may be guessed.</p>

<p>On the land side, it is said to be strengthened
by stone and timber, which we did not
see, but which may be there, covered by
earth and grass. Towards the sea, somewhat
above and considerably below high-water
mark, a strong matting of flags prevents the
surge from carrying away the surface of the
mound; and this is the defence which has
so long preserved it. The matting is held to
the shore by bandages of twisted flags, running
horizontally, at the distance of three
or four yards from each other, and staked
to the ground by strong wooden pins. As
this matting is worn by every tide, a survey
of it is frequently made, and many parts
appear to have been just repaired. Further
in the sea, it is held down by stones; above,
there are posts at every forty yards, which
are numbered, that the spot may be exactly
described where repairs are necessary. The
impost for the maintenance of these banks
amounts to nearly as much as the land-tax;
and, as the land could not be possessed without
it, this tax has the valuable character of
being occasioned by no mismanagement, and
of producing no discontent.</p>

<h3><a name="X-ROTTERDAM" id="X-ROTTERDAM">ROTTERDAM.</a></h3>

<p>From Helvoetsluys to this place the
usual way is by the Brill and Maesland sluice,
with several changes of carriages and boats;
but, on the days of the arrival of mails, a
Rotterdam skipper, whose vessel has been
left at a hamlet on the Maese, takes his party
in carriages across the island of Voorn, on
which Helvoetsluys stands, to his schuyt,
and from thence by the Maese to Rotterdam.
We paid two ducats, or about seventeen
shillings, for the whole, and found this
the highest price given for travelling in Holland.
Our carriage was a sort of small coach
of the fashion, exhibited in paintings of the
sixteenth century, but open before, and so
ill-furnished with springs, that the Dutch
name, "a covered waggon," was not an improper
description of it. A bad road led us
through some meadows of meagre grass, and
through fields in which corn was higher,
though thinner, than in England. The
prospect was over an entire level to the horizon,
except that the spires of distant villages,
some small clusters of trees, and now
and then a wind-mill, varied it. As we approached
any of these clusters, we found
usually a neat farm-house sheltered within,
and included, together with its garden and
orchard, in a perfect green fence: the fields
were elsewhere separated from each other
and from the road, neither by hedges or
walls, but by deep ditches filled with water,
over which are laid small bridges, that may
be opened in the middle by a sort of trap-door,
raised and locked to a post, to prevent
the intrusion of strangers.</p>

<p>On the way we passed now and then a
waggon filled with large brass jugs, bright
as new gold. In these vessels, which have
short narrow necks, covered with a wooden
stopper, milk is brought from the field
throughout Holland. It is always carried
to the towns in light waggons, or carts,
drawn frequently by horses as sleek and
well-conditioned as those in our best coaches.</p>

<p>The hamlet, at which we were to embark,
was busied in celebrating some holiday. At
the only cottage, that had a sign, we applied
for refreshment, partly for the purpose of
seeing its inside, by which we were not a
little gratified. Thirty or forty peasants were
seated upon benches, about a circle, in which
children were dancing to the scraping of a
French fiddler. The women wore their
large hats, set up in the air like a spread
fan, and lined with damask, or flowered
linen. Children of seven years old, as well
as women of seventy, were in this preposterous
disguise. All had necklaces, ear-rings,
and ornamental clasps for the temples, of
solid gold: some wore large black patches
of the size of a shilling. The old woman of
the house had a valuable necklace and head-dress.
Among the group were many of
Teniers' beauties; and over the countenances
of the whole assemblage was an air of modesty,
decorum, and tranquillity. The children
left their dancing, to see us; and we
had almost lost our tide to Rotterdam, by
staying to see them.</p>

<p>Our sail up the Maese was very delightful.
The river flows here with great dignity,
and is animated with vessels of all countries
passing to and from Rotterdam. The
huge Archangelman, the lighter American,
the smart, swift Englishman, and the bulky
Dutchman, exhibit a various scene of shipping,
upon a noble surface of water, winding
between green pastures and rich villages,
spread along the low shores, where pointed
roofs, trees, and masts of fishing-boats, are
seen mingled in striking confusion. Small
trading schuyts, as stout and as round as
their masters, glided by us, with crews reposing
under their deep orange sails, and frequently
exchanging some salute with our
captain. On our left, we passed the little
town of Flaarding, celebrated for its share
of the herring-fishery on our coasts; and
Schiedam, a larger port, where what is called
the Rotterdam geneva is made, and where
several English vessels were visible in the
chief street of the place. After a sail of
two hours we distinguished Rotterdam, surrounded
by more wood than had yet appeared,
and overtopped by the heavy round
tower of the great church of St. Lawrence.
The flatness of its situation did not allow us
here to judge of its extent; but we soon
perceived the grandeur of an ample city,
extending along the north shore of the Maese,
that, now spreading into a noble bay, along
the margin of which Rotterdam rises, sweeps
towards the south-east.</p>

<p>The part of the city first seen, from the
river, is said to be among the finest in Europe
for magnificence and convenience of
situation. It is called the <i>Boom Quay</i>, <i>i. e.</i>
the quay with trees, having rows of lofty
elms upon the broad terrace, that supports
many noble houses, but which is called a
quay, because ships of considerable burthen
may moor against it, and deliver their cargoes.
The merchants accordingly, who have
residences here, have their warehouses adjoining
their houses, and frequently build
them in the form of domestic offices. The
quay is said to be a mile in length, but appears
to be somewhat less. There are houses
upon it, as handsome as any in the squares
of London.</p>

<p>At the top of the <i>Boom Quay</i> is one of
the <i>Heads</i>, or entrances by water into the
city, through which the greater part of its
numerous canals receive their supplies. On
the approach to it, the view further up the
Maese detains attention to the bank of this
noble river. A vast building, erected for
the Admiralty, is made, by a bend of the
Maese, almost to face you; and the interval,
of more than a quarter of a mile, is
filled by a line of houses, that open directly,
and without a terrace, upon the water.
The fronts of these are in another street;
but they all exhibit, even on this side, what
is the distinction of Dutch houses and towns,
a nicety and a perfectness of preservation,
which give them an air of gaiety without, and
present you with an idea of comfort within.
What in England would be thought a symptom
of extraordinary wealth, or extravagance,
is here universal. The outside of
every house, however old or humble, is as
clean as water and paint can make it. The
window-shutters are usually coloured green;
and whatever wood appears, whether in cornices
or worse ornaments, is so frequently
cleaned, as well as painted, that it has always
the gloss of newness. Grotesque ornaments
are sometimes by these means rendered
conspicuous; and a street acquires the
air of a town in a toyshop; but in general
there is not in this respect such a want of
taste as can much diminish the value of their
care.</p>

<p>Our skipper reached his birth, which is
constantly in the same place, soon after passing
the <i>Head</i>, and entering by a canal into
one of the principal streets of the city. Between
the broad terraces of this street, which
are edged with thick elms, the innumerable
masts of Dutch schuyts, with gay pendants
and gilded tops; the hulls of larger vessels
from all parts of the world; the white drawbridges,
covered with passengers; the boats,
continually moving, without noise or apparent
difficulty; all this did somewhat surprise
us, who had supposed that a city so
familiarly known, and yet so little mentioned
as Rotterdam, could have nothing so remarkable
as its wealth and trade.</p>

<p>In our way from the boat to the inn, other
fine canals opened upon us on each side, and
we looked at them till we had lost the man,
whom we should have followed with our
baggage. We had no fear that it would be
stolen, knowing the infrequency of robberies
in Holland; and the first person, of
whom we could enquire our way in broken
Dutch, acknowledged his country people by
answering in very good English. There are
many hundreds of British residents in this
place, and our language and commerce have
greatly the sway here over those of all other
foreign nations. The Dutch inscriptions
over warehouses and shops have frequently
English translations underneath them. Of
large vessels, there are nearly as many
English as Dutch in the harbour; and, if
you speak to any Dutchman in the street,
it is more probable that he can answer in
English than in French. On a Sunday, the
English fill two churches, one of which
we attended on our return. It is an oblong
brick building, permitted by the States
to be within the jurisdiction of the Bishop of
London, Parliament having given 2500l. towards
its completion in the beginning of the
present century. There are also many Protestant
dissenters here, who are said to have
their offices of worship performed with the
ability, simplicity, and zeal, which are usually
to be observed in the devotions of that
class of Christians.</p>

<p>Rotterdam is the second city for size, and
perhaps the first for beauty, in the United
Provinces; yet, when we walked through
it the next day, and expected to find the
magnificence of the approach equalled in its
interior, we were compelled to withdraw a
little of the premature admiration, that had
begun to extend to the whole place. The
street, where there is most trade and the
greatest passage, the <i>Hoogstraat</i>, is little
wider, though it is abundantly cleaner, than
a London lane. The Stadthouse is in this
street, and is an old brick building, with a
peaked roof, not entirely free from fantastic
ornament. It has been built too early to
have the advantages of modern elegance,
and too late for the sanction of ancient dignity.
The market-place has only one wide
access; and the communication between the
street, from the principal <i>Head</i>, and that in
which the Exchange is placed, is partly
through a very narrow, though a short passage.
The Exchange itself is a plain stone
building, well designed for its purpose, and
completed about fifty years ago. The happiest
circumstance relating to it is, that the
merchants are numerous enough to fill the
colonnades on the four sides of its interior.
Commerce, which cannot now be long discouraged
in any part of Europe, because
without it the interest of public debts cannot
be paid, is the permanent defender of
freedom and knowledge against military
glory and politics.</p>

<p>From the Exchange there is an excellent
walk to the market-place, where the well-known
statue of <span class="smallcaps">Erasmus</span> is raised. Being
represented in his doctor's dress, the
figure can display little of the artist's skill;
but the countenance has strong lines, and a
physiognomist would not deny them to be
expressive of the discernment and shrewdness
of the original.</p>

<p>The market-place is really a large bridge,
for a canal passes under it; but its size, and
the easiness of ascent from the sides, prevent
this from being immediately observed. Some
of the surrounding houses have their dates
marked upon glazed tiles. They were built
during the long war, that rescued the provinces
from the Spanish dominion; a time
when it might be supposed that nothing
would have been attended to, except the
business of providing daily food, and the
duty of resisting the enemy; but in which
the Dutch enlarged and beautified their
cities, prepared their country to become a
medium of commerce, and began nearly all
the measures, which have led to their present
extensive prosperity.</p>

<p>Near this place is the great church of St.
<span class="smallcaps">Lawrence</span>, which we entered, but did not
find to be remarkable, except for a magnificent
brass balustrade that crosses it at the
upper end. A profusion of <i>achievements</i>,
which cover the walls almost to the top,
contribute to its solemnity. In addition to
the arms of the deceased, they contain the
dates of their birth and death, and are used
instead of inscriptions, though no names are
expressed upon them. Under the pulpit was
an hour-glass, which limits the discourse of
the preacher: on one side a wand, having
at the end a velvet bag and a small bell;
this is carried about, during an interval in
the service, and every body puts something
into it for the poor. The old beadle, who
shewed us the church, laid his hands upon
us with pleasure, when he heard that we
were English, and Protestants. There are
three ministers to this church, with salaries
of nearly two hundred pounds sterling
each.</p>

<p>We went to our inn through the <i>Hoogstraat</i>,
which was filled with people and carriages,
but has no raised pavement to separate
the one from the other. In all the
towns which we saw, the footpath is distinguished
from the road only by being paved
with a sort of light coloured brick. The
Dutch shops are in the shape, which those
of London are described to have had fifty
years since, with small high windows, and
blocks between them and the street. Silversmiths
expose their goods in small glass
cupboards upon the blocks, and nearly all
the trades make upon them what little shew
is customary. Almost every tenth house
displays the inscription <i>Tabak te koop</i>, "Tobacco
to be sold." This street, having no
canal, is occupied entirely by retail traders.
We bought in it the Antwerp Gazette for
two doights, or one farthing; strawberries,
large and well coloured, at a lower price
than they could be had six weeks later in
England, but without flavour; and went
into several booksellers' shops, expecting to
have found something in Latin, or French,
but could see only Dutch books. In another
street a bookseller had several English volumes,
and there are no doubt well filled
shops, but not so numerous as that we could
find any.</p>

<p>Over the canals, that flow through almost
every street of Rotterdam, are great
numbers of large drawbridges, which contribute
much to the neat and gay appearance
of the city; but, when these are raised, the
obstruction to the passage occasions crowds
on each side; and, therefore, in some of the
most frequented parts, the bridges are entire
and permanent, except for the breadth of
three feet in the centre, where there is a
plank, which opens upon hinges almost as
easily as the lid of a trunk. Through this
opening the masts of the small Dutch schuyts
are easily conducted, but ships can pass
only where there are drawbridges. The
number of the former is immense; for,
throughout the provinces, every village, if
it is near a canal, has several schuyts, which
carry away the superfluous produce of the
country, and return with the manufactures,
or stores of the towns. But neither their
number, nor their neatness, is so remarkable
as the ease and stillness, with which they
traverse the city; and indeed ease and stillness
are much the characteristics of all the
efforts of Dutch industry. The noise and
agitation, usual whenever many persons are
employed together in other countries, are
unknown here. Ships are brought to their
moorings, schuyts pass each other in crowded
canals, heavy burthens are raised and
cargoes removed, almost without a word,
that can be heard at twenty yards distance.</p>

<p>Another circumstance, rendering Dutch
towns freer from noise than others of equal
traffic, is the little use which is made of
waggons and carts, even where some sort
of land carriage must be employed. Heavy
commodities are usually carried about the
streets on sledges; and almost the greatest
noise is, when the driver of one of these,
after having delivered his load, meaning to
render himself a prodigy of frolicsomeness,
stands upon the hinder edges of his sledge,
and then, preventing himself from falling
backward by his hold of the reins, is drawn
rapidly through the admiring crowd.</p>

<p>We were long enough at Rotterdam,
during three visits, to see how well it is
provided with avenues towards the country
and along the banks of the Maese. To
one of these the way is over the two <i>Heads</i>,
or chief canals, each of which you cross
for a doight, or half a farthing, in boats
that are continually passing between the two
sides. This little voyage saves a walk of
about three hundred yards to the nearest
bridge. The boats will hold twenty or
thirty persons, and the profit of them is
very considerable to the City government,
which applies the money to public purposes.
Each boat is worked by one man,
who pulls it over by a rope in about two
minutes.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants have what they
call garden-houses upon these walks, and
upon a semi-circular road, which passes on
the land side of the city; but the most
wealthy have seats at greater distances,
where they can be surrounded with grounds,
and make the display of independent residences.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, Rotterdam has from
its situation many conveniences and delights,
and from its structure some magnificence,
together with a general neatness; but is, for
the most part, deficient in elegance, and its
beauties have too much the air of prettinesses.
The canals are indisputably fine,
crowned with lofty terraces, and deep
enough to carry large vessels into the centre
of the city.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="DELFT" id="DELFT">DELFT.</a></h3>

<p>Between Rotterdam and this place
we commenced our travelling in trechtschuyts,
which are too well known to need
description. The fare is at the rate of about
a penny per mile, and a trifle more hires the
<i>roof</i>, which is a small separate chamber, nearest
to the stern of the vessel, lighted by windows
on each side. In engaging this, you
have an instance of the accuracy of the
Dutch in their minutest transactions; a formal
printed receipt, or ticket, is given for
the few pence which it costs, by a commissary,
who has no other business than to regulate
the affairs of the trechtschuyts at his
gate of the city. We could never learn
what proportion of the fare is paid as a tax
to the State, but it is said to be a considerable
part; and not only these schuyts, but
the ferries, the post waggons, and the pilotage
throughout the United States, are made
contributory to the public funds.</p>

<p>The punctuality of the departure and
arrival of the trechtschuyts is well known,
and justifies the Dutch method of reckoning
distances, which is by hours, and not by
leagues or miles. The canals being generally
full to the brim, the top of the vessel is
above the level of the adjoining country,
and the view over it is of course extensive;
but the houses and gardens, which are best
worth seeing, are almost always upon the
banks of the canal. We passed several such
in the way to Delft, towards which the Rotterdam
merchants have their favourite seats;
but Dutch gardens are rather to be noticed
by an Englishman as curiosities, than as
luxuries. It is not only by the known ill
taste of their ornaments, but by the effects
of climate and the soil, that gardens are
deprived of value, in a country, where the
moisture is so disproportioned to the heat,
that the verdure, though bright, has no
fragrance, and the fruit, at its utmost size,
scarcely any flavour.</p>

<p>A passage of two hours brought us to
Delft, which we had expected to find a small
and ill-inhabited place, knowing it to be not
now occupied by any considerable trade.
Our inn, we supposed, must be within a
few minutes walk. We proceeded, however,
through one street for half a mile, and,
after some turnings, did not reach our inn,
though we were led by the nearest way, in
less than twenty minutes. During all this
time we were upon the terraces of clear
canals, amongst excellent houses, with a
small intermixture of shops and some public
buildings. The mingled admiration and
weariness, which we felt here, for the first
time, have been, however, often repeated;
for if there is a necessity for saying what
is the next distinction of Dutch towns, after
their neatness, their size must be insisted
upon. There are Dutch villages, scarcely
marked in a map, which exceed in size
some of the county towns in England.
<i>Maesland Sluice</i>, a place opposite to the
Brill, is one. And here is Delft, a place
with scarcely any other trade than consists in
the circulation of commodities from Rotterdam
through some neighbouring villages;
which is not the seat of any considerable
part of the national government, and is inferior,
in point of situation, to all the surrounding
towns. Delft, thus undistinguished,
fills a large circumference, with streets so
intricately thick, that we never went from
our inn without losing our way.</p>

<p>The <i>Doolen</i>, one of the best inns in Holland,
is a large building of the sixteenth
century, raised by the Spaniards, and first
intended to be a convent; but, having been
used by the burghers of Delft for public
purposes, during the struggle of the Province
against Spain, it is now venerable as the
scene of their councils and preparations. In
the suite of large apartments, which were
used by them, some of the city business is still
transacted, and in these strangers are never
entertained. Behind, is a bowling-green, in
which the burghers to this day perform
their military exercises; they were so employed
when we came in; and it was pleasing
to consider, that their inferiority to their
ancestors, in point of martial appearance,
was the result of the long internal peace secured
by the exertions of the latter.</p>

<p>Over two arches of the building is the
date of its erection, 1565, the year in which
the destruction of all families, professing the
Protestant religion either in France or Spain,
is supposed to have been agreed upon at
Bayonne between the sovereigns of the two
countries, and one year preceding the first
measures of confederate resistance in the
Low Countries, which that and other efforts
of persecution produced. One of these
arches communicates with the rooms so long
used by the burghers; and our hostess, an
intelligent woman, accompanied us through
them. The first is ornamented with three
large pictures, representing several of the
early burghers of the Commonwealth, either
in arms or council. A portrait of <span class="smallcaps">Barneveldt</span>
is marked with the date and the painter's
name, "<span class="smallcaps">Michael Miereveld</span>
<i>delineavit ac perfunctori&egrave; pinxit, 1617</i>,"
one year before the flagitious arrest of
<span class="smallcaps">Barneveldt</span>, in defiance of the constitution
of the provinces, by <span class="smallcaps">Maurice</span> of
<span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>. A piece, exhibiting some of the
burghers in arms, men of an handsome and
heroic appearance, is also dated, by having
1648 painted on a drum; that, which shews
them in council, has a portrait of <span class="smallcaps">Grotius</span>,
painted when he was seventeen. His face
is the seventh from the right hand in the
second row.</p>

<p>Beyond this room are others containing
several score of small cupboards, on the
doors of each of which are two or three
blazonries of arms. Here are deposited some
parts of the dress and arms of an association
of Arquesbusiers, usual in all the Dutch
towns; the members of which society assemble
annually in October, to shoot at a target
placed in a pavilion of the old convent garden.
The marksman takes his aim from the
farthest room; and between him and the
mark are two walls, perforated two feet and
a half in length, and eight inches in breadth,
to permit the passage of the shot. A man
stands in the pavilion, to tell where the ball
has struck; and every marksman, before he
shoots, rings a bell, to warn this person out
of the way. He that first hits a white spot
in the target, has his liquor, for the ensuing
year, free of excise duty; but, to render
this more difficult, a stork is suspended by
the legs from a string, which, passing down
the whole length of the target, is kept in
continual motion by the agitation of the
bird. It did not appear whether the stork
has any other share in this ancient ceremony,
which is represented in prints of considerable
date. It is held near the ground, out
of the way of the shot, and is certainly not
intended to be hurt, for the Dutch have no
taste for cruelty in their amusements. The
stork, it is also known, is esteemed by them
a sort of tutelary bird; as it once was in
Rome, where <span class="smallcaps">Asellus Sempronius Rufus</span>,
who first had them served at an entertainment,
is said to have lost the Pr&aelig;torship
for his sacrilegious gluttony. In
these trivial enquiries we passed our first
evening at Delft.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, a battalion of regular
troops was reviewed upon a small plain
within the walls of the town. The uniform
is blue and red, in which the Dutch officers
have not quite the smart appearance of ours.
One of these, who gave the word to a company,
was a boy, certainly not more than fifteen,
whose shrill voice was ludicrously heard
between the earnest shouts of the others.
The firing was very exact, which is all that
we can tell of the qualities of a review.</p>

<p>Delft was a place of early importance in
the United Provinces, being one of the six
original cities, that sent Deputies to the States
of the province; a privilege, which, at the
instance of their glorious <span class="smallcaps">William</span> the
First of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>, was afterwards properly
extended to twelve others, including Rotterdam
and the Brill. Yet it is little celebrated
for military events, being unfortified, and
having probably always obeyed the fortune
of the neighbouring places. The circumstance
which gives it a melancholy place in
history, is the murder of the wife and
beneficent Prince who founded the republic. His
palace, a plain brick building, is still in good
repair, where strangers are always shewn the
staircase on which he fell, and the holes
made in the wall by the shot that killed
him. The old man, who keeps the house,
told the story with as much agitation and
interest as if it had happened yesterday.
"The Prince and Princess came out of that
chamber&mdash;there stood the Prince, here stood
the murderer; when the Prince stepped here
to speak to him about the passport, the villain
fired, and the Prince fell all along here
and died. Yes, so it was&mdash;there are the
holes the balls made." Over one of these,
which is large enough to admit two fingers,
is this inscription:</p>

<p>"<i>Hier onder staen de Teykenen der Kooglen
daar meede Prins Willem van Orange is
doorschootten op</i> 10 July, A. 1584."</p>

<p>To this detestable action the assassin acknowledged
himself to have been instigated
by the proclamation of Philip the Second,
offering a reward for its perpetration. The
Princess, who had the wretchedness to witness
it, had lost her father and her former
husband in the massacre of St. Bartholomew
in France, which, though contrived by Catherine
and Charles the Ninth of that country,
is believed to have been the consequence
of their interview at Bayonne, with
Isabella, the wife of the same Philip.</p>

<p>The melancholy excited on this spot is
continued by passing from it to the tomb of
<span class="smallcaps">William</span>, in the great church, called the
<i>Nieuwe Kerk</i>. There the gloomy pageantry
of the black escutcheons, above a choir,
silent, empty and vast, and the withering
remains of colours, won by hands long since
gone to their decay, prolong the consideration
of the transientness of human worth
and happiness, which can so easily be destroyed
by the command, or the hand of
human villainy.</p>

<p>This tomb is thought to be not exceeded
by any piece of sepulchral grandeur in Europe.
Standing alone, in a wide choir, it is
much more conspicuous and striking than
a monumental fabric raised against a wall,
at the same time that its sides are so varied as
to present each a new spectacle. It was begun
in 1609, by order of the States General,
and completed in 1621; the artist, <span class="smallcaps">Hendrik
de Keyzer</span>, receiving 28,000 florins
as its price, and 2000 more as a present.
The length is 20 feet, the breadth 15, and
height 27. A bronze statue of the Prince,
sitting in full armour, with his sword, scarf,
and commander's staff, renders one side the
chief; on the other is his effigy in white
marble, lying at full length; and at his feet,
in the same marble, the figure of the dog,
which is said to have refused food from the
moment of its master's death. Round the
tomb, twenty-two columns of veined or
black Italian marble, of the Doric order, and,
with bases and capitals of white marble, support
a roof or canopy, ornamented with
many emblems, and with the <i>achievements</i>
of the Prince.</p>

<p>At the corners, are the statues of Religion,
Liberty, Justice, and Fortitude, of which the
first rests upon a piece of black marble, on
which is inscribed in golden letters the name
of <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span>; and the second holds a cap,
with the inscription <i>Aurea Libertas</i>. On
the four sides of the canopy are the devices
of the Prince, with the inscriptions <span class="smallcaps">Jehovah</span>.&mdash;<i>Je
maintiendrai Pi&eacute;t&eacute; et Justice.</i>&mdash;<i>Te
Vindice, tuta Libertas.</i>&mdash;And, <i>S&aelig;vis
tranquillus in Undis</i>.</p>

<p>There are many other ornaments, which
give dignity or elegance to the structure,
but cannot be described without tediousness.
The well-known Epitaph is certainly worth
transcribing:</p>

<p>D. O. M. et etern&aelig; memori&aelig; Gulielmi

<p>"To <span class="smallcaps">God</span> the best and highest, and to
the eternal memory of William of Nassau,
Sovereign Prince of Orange, the father of
his country, whose welfare he preferred to
that of himself and his family; who, chiefly
at his own expence, twice levied and introduced
a powerful army; under the sanction
of the States repelled the tyranny of Spain;
recovered and restored the service of true
religion and the ancient laws of the country;
and finally left the liberty, which he
had himself asserted, to be established by his
son, Prince Maurice, the heir of his father's
virtues. The Confederated Belgic Provinces
have erected this monument, in perpetual
memory of this truly pious, prudent and unconquered
Hero, whom Philip II. King of
Spain, the dread of Europe, dreaded; never
overcame, never terrified; but, with wicked
treachery, carried off by means of an hired
assassin."</p>

<p>The tomb of <span class="smallcaps">Grotius</span> is in the same
church, which is a stately building of brick
and stone, but has nothing of the "dim
religious light," that sooths the mind in
Gothic structures. Upon the steeple are
many small bells, the chimes rung upon
which are particularly esteemed, both for
tone and tune.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of a very large
market-place is the Town-house, an old
building, but so fresh and so fantastic with
paint, as to have some resemblance to a
Chinese temple. The body is coloured
with a light, or yellowish brown, and is two
stories high to the roof, in which there are
two tier of peaked windows, each under its
ornament of gilded wood, carved into an
awkward resemblance of shells. Upon the
front is inscribed, "<i>Delphensium Curia Reparata</i>,"
and immediately over the door
"<i>Reparata 1761</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Oude Kerk</i>, or Old Church, is in another
part of the town, and is not remarkable,
except for the tombs of <span class="smallcaps">Leuwenhoek</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Peter Heine</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Van Tromp</span>. That
of <span class="smallcaps">Leuwenhoek</span> has a short inscription, in
Latin almost as bad as that of a verse epitaph
upon <span class="smallcaps">Grotius</span>, in the other church.
He was born, it appears, in October 1632,
and died in August 1723. The tombs of
<span class="smallcaps">Heine</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Van Tromp</span> are very handsome.
There are the effigies of both in
white marble, and one of the victories gained
by the latter is represented in <i>alto relievo</i>.
On account of the tombs, both churches
are open, during certain hours in the day;
and a beadle, or, perhaps, an almsman, is
placed in each, who presents a padlocked
box, into which money may be put for
the poor.</p>

<p>In this town is the chief arsenal of the
province of Holland, except that the magazine
of powder is at the distance of about
a mile from it, near the canal to Rotterdam.
In 1787, when the dissensions between
the <span class="smallcaps">States General</span> and the
<span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span> were at their height,
a provincial free corps seized this arsenal, and
held it for the States till the return of the
<span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span> to the Hague, a few
weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>Having seen what was pointed out to our
notice, at Delft, and learned that its
extensiveness was owing to the residence of a
great number of retired merchants from
Rotterdam, we left it in a <i>trechtschuyt</i> for
the Hague, having little other notion of it
in our minds, than that it is very dull and
very rich, and of a size, for which there is
no recompense to a stranger, except in considering,
that its dullness is the rest of those,
who have once been busy, and that its
riches are at least not employed in aggravating
the miseries of poverty by ostentation.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HAGUE" id="THE_HAGUE">THE HAGUE.</a></h3>

<p>A voyage of an hour and a half
brought us here over a canal well bordered
by country houses and gardens, all of which,
as in other parts of Holland, have some inscription
upon their gates, to say, that they
are pleasant, or are intended for pleasure.
<i>Fine Sight</i>, <i>Pleasant Rest</i>, <i>High Delight</i>, or
some similar inscription, is to be seen over
the door of every country house, in gold letters.
On our way, we looked for Ryswick,
where the treaty of 1697 was signed, and
saw the village, but not the palace, which,
being of free stone, is mentioned as a sort of
curiosity in the country. It is this palace,
which is said to contain proofs of an extraordinary
dispute upon questions of ceremony.
The Ambassadors, sent to prepare
the treaty, are related to have contended so
long, concerning their rights of precedence,
that the only mode of reconciling them was
to make separate entrances, and to allow the
Mediating Minister alone admission by the
principal gate.</p>

<p>From the <i>trechtschuyt</i> we had a long walk
to our inn, an handsome house, standing
almost in the midst of palaces, and looking
over a noble sheet of water, called the <i>Vyver</i>,
which extends behind the <i>Court</i>, for its
whole length, flowing nearly to the level of
the lower windows. The <i>Court</i> itself, a
large brick building, irregular, but light and
pleasant, was entirely within our view, on
the left; on the right, a row of magnificent
houses, separated from the <i>Vyver</i> by a large
mall; and, in front, beyond the <i>Vyver</i>, a
broad place, bordered by several public buildings.
In this Court all the superior colleges
of government have their chambers, and the
<span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span> his suite of apartments.
The foss&eacute;, which surrounds it, three drawbridges
and as many gates are the only fortifications
of the Hague, which has been several
times threatened with the entrance of
an enemy, but has not been taken since 1595,
when the magistrates of the then infant republic,
and all the superior inhabitants, retired
to <i>Delft</i>, leaving the streets to be overrun
with grass, and the place to become a
desert under the eyes of its oppressors.
During the invasion of <span class="smallcaps">Louis</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Fourteenth</span>,
it escaped the ravages of the
<span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Luxembourg's</span> column, by the
sudden dissolution of the ice, on which he
had placed 9000 foot and 2000 cavalry.
Yet the advice of <span class="smallcaps">William</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Third</span>,
who probably thought money better expended
in strengthening the frontier than
the interior of the country, counteracted a
plan of fortification, which was then proposed,
for the third or fourth time.</p>

<p>The Court consists of two squares; in
the inner of which are the apartments of the
<span class="smallcaps">Stadtholder</span>, and none but himself and
his family can enter this in carriages, or on
horseback. On the northern side, in the first
floor, are the apartments of the <span class="smallcaps">States
General</span>, which we saw. The principal
one is spacious, as a room, but has not the
air of a hall of debate. Twenty-six chairs
for the Deputies are placed on two sides of
a long table: the President, whose chair is
in the centre, has on his right hand, first,
a Deputy of his own province, then three
Deputies of Friesland, and two of Groningen;
on his left, six Deputies of Holland;
opposite to him, nearest to the head of the
table, six Deputies of Guelderland, then
three of Zealand, then two of Utrecht, and
two of Overyssel. The <span class="smallcaps">Stadtholder</span>,
who has a place, but not a vote, has a raised
chair at the upper end of the table; the Secretary
is seated opposite to him, and is allowed
to wear his hat, like the Deputies,
during their deliberations, but must stand
uncovered, behind the President, when he
reads letters, or other papers. The number
of Deputies is known to be indefinite;
about fifty are generally returned; and those,
who are present from each province, more
than the number allowed at the table, place
themselves below it. The walls of this room
are covered with tapestry, not representing
historical events, but rural scenery; the backs
and seats of the chairs are of green velvet;
and all the furniture, though stately and in
the best condition, is without the least approach
to show. These apartments, and
the whole of this side of the Court, were the
residence of <span class="smallcaps">Charles</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Fifth</span>, when he
visited the Hague, and of the <span class="smallcaps">Earl</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Leicester</span>,
when he commanded the troops
lent to the Republic by <span class="smallcaps">Elizabeth</span>.</p>

<p>The government of the United Provinces
is too well known to permit a detailed description
here, but some notice may reasonably
be expected of it.</p>

<p>The chief depositaries of the sovereignty
are not the States General, but the Provincial
States, of whose Deputies the former
body is composed, and without whose consent
they never vote upon important measures.
In the States General each Province
has one vote; which, with the reasons for
it, may be delivered by an unlimited number
of Deputies; and the first Deputy of each
province presides in the States by rotation
for a week. In questions relative to peace
or war, alliances, taxes, coinages, and to the
privileges of provinces, no measures can be
taken but by unanimous consent; upon
other occasions, a majority is sufficient. No
persons holding military offices can be Deputies
to the States General, which appoints
and receives all ambassadors, declares war,
makes peace, and names the Greffier, or Secretary
of State, and all Staff Officers.</p>

<p>The Provincial States are variously composed,
and the interior governments of the
provinces variously formed. In the province
of Holland, which contains the most
prosperous part of the Republic, there are
eighteen Deputies to the Provincial States,
for as many towns, and one for the nobility.
The Grand Pensionary presides in this assembly,
and is always one of the Deputies
from it to the States General.</p>

<p>The Council of Deputies is composed of
ten members: nine from the towns, and one
from the nobility. This Council, in which
the Grand Pensionary also presides, regulates
the finances of the province, and takes
cognizance of the distribution of troops
within it.</p>

<p>The Council, called the Council of State,
is composed, like the States General, of
Deputies returned from the provinces, and
appears to be to that body, in a great measure,
what the Council of Deputies is to
the Provincial States, having the direction
of the army and the finances.</p>

<p>As provincial affairs are directed by the
Provincial States, so the affairs of each town
are governed by its own Senate, which also
returns the members, if the town is entitled
to send one, to the States of the Province,
and directs the vote, which that member
shall give. The Burgomasters in each town
are the magistrates charged with the police
and the finances, and are usually elected
annually by the old Council, that is, by those
who have been Burgomasters, or <i>Echevins</i>.
These latter officers have the administration
of civil and criminal affairs, and are, in
some places, appointed by the Stadtholder
from a double number nominated to him;
in others, are accepted from the recommendation
of the Stadtholder. The Bailiffs preside
in the Council of Burgomasters and
Echevins; and in their name prosecutions
are instituted.</p>

<p>Of the Deputies to the States General,
some are for life, and some for one or more
years.</p>

<p>Such is the nicely complicated frame of
this government, in which the Senates of the
Towns elect the Provincial States, and the
Provincial States the States General; the
latter body being incapable of deciding in
certain cases, except with unanimity and
with the express consent of their constituents,
the Provincial States; who again cannot
give that consent, except with
unanimity and with the consent of their constituents,
the Senates.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder, it is seen, has not directly,
and in consequence of that office, any
share of the legislative power; but, being a
Noble of four provinces, he, of course, participates
in that part of the sovereignty,
which the Nobility enjoy when they send
Deputies to the Provincial States. Of Zealand
he is the only Noble, all the other
titled families having been destroyed in the
original contest with Spain; and there are
no renewals or creations of titles in the
United Provinces. In Guelderland, Holland,
and Utrecht, he is President of the
Nobles. He is Commander of all the
Forces of the Republic by sea and land;
and the Council of State, of which he is a
member, is, in military affairs, almost entirely
under his direction; he names all
subaltern officers, and recommends those
for higher appointments to the States
General. In Guelderland, Utrecht, and Overyssel,
which are called <i>Provinces aux Reglemens</i>,
because, having submitted to <span class="smallcaps">Louis</span>
the <span class="smallcaps">Fourteenth</span>, in 1672, they were not
re-admitted to the Union, but with some sacrifice
of their privileges, he appoints to offices,
without the nomination of the cities;
he is Governor General of the East and West
Indian Companies, and names all the Directors
from a treble number of candidates
offered by the Proprietors. His name presides
in all the courts of law; and his heart,
it may be hoped, dictates in the noble right
of pardoning.</p>

<p>This is the essential form of a government,
which, for two centuries, has protected
as great a share of civil and religious
liberty as has been enjoyed in any other
part of Europe, resisting equally the chances
of dissolution, contained within itself; and
the less dangerous schemes for its destruction,
dictated by the jealousy of arbitrary
interests without.</p>

<p>Its intricacy and delicacy are easily seen;
yet, of the objections made to it on this account,
more are founded on some maxims,
assumed to be universal, than upon the separate
considerations due to the condition
of a separate people. How much the means
of political happiness depend, for their effect,
upon the civil characters of those for
whom they are designed, has been very little
seen, or insisted upon. It has been unnoticed,
because such enquiries have not the
brilliancy, or the facility, of general speculations,
nor can command equal attention,
nor equally reward systems with those parts
of their importance, that consist in the immensity
of the sphere, to which they pretend.
To extend their arms is the flagitious ambition
of warriors; to enlarge their systems is
the ambition of writers, especially of political
writers. A juster effort of understanding
would aim at rendering the application
of principles more exact, rather than more
extensive, and would produce enquiries into
the circumstances of national character and
condition, that should regulate that application.
A more modest estimate of human
means of doing good would shew the gradations,
through which all human advances
must be made. A more severe integrity of
views would stipulate, that the means should
be as honest as the end, and would strive to
ascertain, from the moral and intellectual
character of a people, the degree of political
happiness, of which they are capable; a process,
without which projected advances become
obstructions; and the philosopher begins
his experiment, for the amelioration of
society, as prematurely as the sculptor would
polish his statue before he had delineated
the features.</p>

<p>Whether the constitution of the United
Provinces is exactly as good an one as the
people are capable of enjoying, can be determined
only after a much longer and abler
enquiry than we could make; but it seemed
proper to observe, that, in judging this
question, it is not enough to discover better
forms of government, without finding also
some reason to believe, that the intellectual
and moral condition of the people would secure
the existence of those better forms. In
the mean time, they, who make the enquiry,
may be assured, that, under the present <span class="small"><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></span><a name="fn1r" id="fn1r"></a> government,
there is a considerable degree of
political liberty, though political happiness is
not permitted by the present circumstances
of Europe; that the general adoption of
the Stadtholder's measures by the States has
been unduly mentioned to shew an immoderate
influence, for that, in point of fact,
his measures are often rejected; that this rejection
produces no public agitation, nor can
those, who differ from him in opinion, be
successfully represented as enemies to their
country; that there are very few offices,
which enable private persons to become
rich, at the expence of the public, so as to
have a different interest from them; that the
sober industry and plain manners of the
people prevent them from looking to political
conduct of any sort as a means of improving
their fortunes; that, for these reasons,
the intricate connections between the
parts of their government are less inconvenient
than may be supposed, since good measures
will not be obstructed, or bad ones
supported, for corrupt purposes, though misconceptions
may sometimes produce nearly
the same effect; that conversation is perfectly
free; and that the habit of watching
the strength of parties, for the purpose of
joining the strongest and persecuting the
weakest, does not occupy the minds of any
numerous classes amongst them.</p>

<p><a href="#fn1r">1</a><a name="fn1" id="fn1"> </a>June 1794.</p>

<p>We saw no other apartments than those of
the States General, the <span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>
being then in his own. The Princess was
at a seat in Guelderland, with her daughter-in-law,
the wife of the Hereditary Prince,
who had been indisposed since the surprise
of the Dutch troops at Menin, on the 12th
of September 1793, in which affair her
husband was engaged. When the officer,
who brought the first accounts, which were
not written, to the Hague, had related that
the younger prince was wounded, the Hereditary
Princess enquired, with great eagerness,
concerning his brother. The officer
indiscreetly replied, that he knew nothing of
him; which the Princess supposed to imply,
that he was dead; and she has since been
somewhat an invalid.</p>

<p>Though the salaries enjoyed by the Prince
of Orange, in consequence of his offices,
are by no means considerable, he is enabled,
by his patrimonial estates, to maintain some
modest splendour. The Court is composed
of a grand master, a marshal, a grand equerry,
ten chamberlains, five ladies of honour,
and six gentlemen of the chamber. Ten
young men, with the title of pages, are
educated at the expence of the Prince, in
a house adjoining his <i>manege</i>. As Captain-General,
he is allowed eight adjutants, and,
as Admiral, three.</p>

<p>We could not learn the amount of the
income enjoyed by the <span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>,
which must, indeed, be very variable, arising
chiefly from his own estates. The greater
part of these are in the province of Zealand,
where seventeen villages and part of the
town of Breda are his property. The fortifications
of several places there are said to
have been chiefly erected at the expence of
the Orange family. His farms in that neighbourhood
suffered greatly in the campaign
of 1792, and this part of his income has
since been much diminished. The management
of his revenues, derived from possessions
in Germany, affords employment to
four or five persons, at an Office, separate
from his ordinary Treasury; and he had
estates in the Low Countries. All this is
but the wreck of a fortune, honourably diminished
by William the First of Orange,
in the contest with Spain; the remembrance
of whom may, perhaps, involuntarily influence
one's opinion of his successors.</p>

<p>During May, the western gate of the
palace is ornamented, according to ancient
custom, with garlands for each person of the
Orange family. Chaplets, with the initials
of each, in flowers, are placed under large
coronets, upon green flag-staffs. We passed
by when they were taking these down, and
perceived that all the ornaments could scarcely
have cost five shillings. So humble are the
Dutch notions of pageantry.</p>

<p>Among the offices included within the
walls of the court is a printing-house, in
which the <span class="smallcaps">States General</span> and the States
of Holland employ only persons sworn to
secrecy as to the papers committed to them.
It may seem strange to require secrecy from
those, whose art is chiefly useful in conferring
publicity; but the truth is, that many
papers are printed here, which are never
communicated to the public, the States employing
the press for the sake of its cheapness,
and considering that any of their
members, who would shew a printed paper,
would do the same with a written one.</p>

<p>In a large square, near the court, is the
cabinet of natural history, of which we have
not the knowledge necessary for giving a
description. It is arranged in small rooms,
which are opened, at twelve o'clock, to
those, who have applied the day before.
One article, said to be very rare, and certainly
very beautiful, was an animal of the
Deer species, about fourteen inches high,
exquisitely shaped and marked, and believed
to be at its full growth. It was brought
from the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder's library was accidentally
shut, owing to the illness of the librarian.
The picture gallery was open, but of
paintings we have resolved to exempt our
readers from any mention. The former is
said to contain eight thousand volumes,
and fourteen thousand prints in portfolios.
Among the illuminated MSS. in vellum is
one, used by the sanguinary Catherine De
Medicis and her children; and another,
which belonged to Isabella of Castille, the
grandmother of Charles the Fifth. What
must be oddly placed in a library is a suit
of armour of Francis the First, which was
once in the cabinet of Christina of Sweden.
Though this collection is the private property
of the Prince, the librarian is permitted
to lend books to persons, known to him
and likely to use them advantageously for
science.</p>

<p>We passed a long morning in walking
through the streets of this place, which contain
probably more magnificent houses than
can be found in the same space in any city
of Northern Europe. The Grand <i>Voorbout</i>
is rather, indeed, two series of palaces than
a street. Between two broad carriage-ways,
which pass immediately along the sides, are
several alleys of tall lime trees, canopying
walks, first laid out by Charles the Fifth,
in 1536, and ordered to be carefully preserved,
the <i>placard</i> being still extant, which
directs the punishment of offenders against
them. It would be tedious to mention the
many splendid buildings in this and the
neighbouring streets. Among the most conspicuous
is the present residence of the British
Ambassadors, built by <span class="smallcaps">Huguetan</span>, the
celebrated banker of <span class="smallcaps">Louis</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Fourteenth</span>,
and that of the Russian Minister,
which was erected by the Pensionary <span class="smallcaps">Barneveldt</span>.
But the building, which was
intended to exceed all others at the Hague,
is the Hotel of the Prince of <span class="smallcaps">Nassau
Weilbourg</span>; who, having married the
sister of the <span class="smallcaps">Prince</span> of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>, bought,
at an immense expence, eight good houses,
facing the <i>Voorbout</i>, in order to erect upon
their scite a magnificent palace. What has
been already built of this is extremely fine,
in the crescent form; but a German, arriving
to the expenditure of a Dutch fortune,
probably did not estimate it by Dutch prices.
It was begun eighteen years since, and, for
the last twelve, has not proceeded.</p>

<p>Superb public buildings occur at almost
every step through the Hague. At one end
of the terrace, on which we were lodged,
is the <i>Doelen</i>, a spacious mansion, opening
partly upon the <i>Tournois Veld</i>, or Place of
Tournaments. The burgesses here keep
their colours, and, what is remarkable, still
preserve the <i>insignia</i> of the <i>Toison d'Or</i>,
given to them by <span class="smallcaps">Charles</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Fifth</span>.
Our <span class="smallcaps">William</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Third</span> being admitted,
at ten years of age, to the right of a burgess
here, was invested with this order by the
Burgomaster. At the other end of the terrace
is the palace, built for Prince <span class="smallcaps">Maurice</span>
of <span class="smallcaps">Nassau</span>, upon his return from the government
of Brazil, by <span class="smallcaps">Kampfen</span>, Lord
of Rambroek, architect of the Stadthouse at
Amsterdam. The interior of this building
was destroyed by fire, in the commencement
of the present century; but, the stately
walls of stone and brick being uninjured, the
rooms were restored by the proprietors, assisted
by a lottery. It is an instance of the
abundance of buildings here, that this palace
is now chiefly used as a place of meeting,
for the &oelig;conomical branch of the society of
Haerlem, and for a society, instituted here,
for the encouragement of Dutch poetry.</p>

<p>The number of public buildings is much
increased by the houses, which the eighteen
towns provide for their Deputies, sent to the
States of the Province. These are called the
<i>Logements</i> of the several towns; and there
has been a great deal of emulation, as to
their magnificence. Amsterdam and Rotterdam
have the finest.</p>

<p>The churches are not remarkable for antiquity,
or grandeur. A congregation of
English Protestants have their worship performed,
in the manner of the Dissenters, in
a small chapel near the <i>Vyver</i>, where we had
the satisfaction to hear their venerable pastor,
the Rev. Dr. <span class="smallcaps">M'Clean</span>.</p>

<p>The residence of a Court at the Hague
renders the appearance of the inhabitants
less national and characteristic than elsewhere.
There are few persons in the streets,
who, without their orange cockades, might
not be mistaken for English; but ribbons
of this colour are almost universal, which
some wear in their hats, and some upon a
button-hole of the coat. The poorest persons,
and there are more poor here than
elsewhere, find something orange-coloured
to shew. Children have it placed upon their
caps; so that the practice is carried to an
extent as ridiculous, as the prohibition was
in 1785, when the magistrates ordered, that
<i>nothing orange-coloured should be worn, or
shewn, not even fruits, or flowers, and that
carrots should not be exposed to sale with the
ends outwards</i>.</p>

<p>The distinctions between political classes
are very strongly marked and preserved in
Holland. We were informed, that there are
some villages, in which the wearing of a
cockade, and others, in which the want of
one, would expose a passenger, especially
a native, to insults. In the cities, where
those of both parties must transact business
together, the distinction is not much observed.
In Amsterdam, the friends of the
Stadtholder do not wear cockades. For the
most part, the seamen, farmers and labouring
classes in the towns are attached to the
Orange family, whose opponents are chiefly
composed of the opulent merchants and
tradesmen.</p>

<p>A history, or even a description of the
two parties, if we were enabled to give it,
would occupy too much space here; but it
may be shortly mentioned, that the original,
or chief cause of the dissension was, as might
be expected, entirely of a commercial nature.
The English interest had an unanimous popularity
in Holland, about the year 1750.
In the war of 1756, the French, having sustained
a great loss of shipping, employed
Dutch vessels to bring the produce of their
American islands to Europe, and thus established
a considerable connection with the
merchants of Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
The Court of Versailles took care, that the
stream of French wealth, which they saw
setting into the United Provinces, should
carry with it some French politics; while
the wealth itself effected more than all their
contrivance, and gradually produced a kindness
for France, especially in the province
of Holland, through which it chiefly circulated.
The English Ministers took all
Dutch ships, having French property on
board; and the popularity of England was
for a time destroyed. Several maritime
towns, probably with some instigation from
France, demanded a war against England.
The friends of the Stadtholder prevented
this; and from that time the Prince began
to share whatever unpopularity the measures
of the English Ministers, or the industry
of the English traders, could excite in
a rival and a commercial country.</p>

<p>The capture of the French West India
islands soon after removed the cause of the
dispute; but the effects of it survived in the
jealousy of the great cities towards the Stadtholder,
and were much aggravated by the
losses of their merchants, at the commencement
of hostilities between England and the
United Provinces, in 1780. The Dutch
fleet being then unprepared to sail, and
every thing, which could float, having been
sent out of the harbours of Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire to intercept their trading ships,
the fortunes of many of the most opulent
houses in Holland were severely shook, and
all their members became the enemies of the
Stadtholder.</p>

<p>If to these circumstances it is added, that
the province of Holland, which pays fifty-eight
parts of every hundred, levied by taxes,
has an ambition for acquiring greater influence
in the general government, than is bestowed
by its single vote, we have probably
all the original causes of the party distinctions
in Holland, though others may have
been incorporated with others, during a long
series of events and many violent struggles
of the passions.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder, who has had the misfortune
to attract so much attention by his
difficulties, is said to be a man of plain manners
and sound understanding, neither capable
of political intrigue, nor inclined to it.
His office requires, especially during a war,
a great deal of substantial, personal labour,
to which he devotes himself earnestly and
continually, but which he has not the vigour
to bear, without an evident oppression of
spirits. We saw him at a parade of the
Guards, and it is not necessary to be told of
his labours to perceive how much he is
affected by them. It is scarcely possible to
conceive a countenance more expressive of
a mind, always urged, always pressed upon,
and not often receiving the relief of complete
confidence in its efforts. His person
is short and extremely corpulent; his air
in conversation modest and mild. This attendance
upon the parade is his chief exercise,
or relaxation at the Hague, where he
frequently passes ten of the hours between
five in a morning and nine at night in his
cabinet. He comes, accompanied by one
or two officers, and his presence produces
no crowd. When we had viewed the parade
and returned home, we saw him walking
under our windows towards the <i>Voorbout</i>,
accompanied by an officer, but not followed
by a single person.</p>

<p>Conversation does not turn so much upon
the family of the Stadtholder, as that we
could acquire any distinct opinions of the
other parts of it. Of his humanity and
temper, there was sufficient proof, in 1787,
when he returned to the Hague and was
master of the persons of those, who had
lately banished him. Indeed, the conduct
of both parties, with respect to the personal
safety of their adversaries, was honourable
to the character of the nation. The States
of Holland, during the prevalence of their
authority, did not pretend, according to the
injustice of similar cases, to any right of
destroying the friends of the Stadtholder,
who were in their hands; the Stadtholder,
when he returned, and when the public detestation
of his adversaries was at an height,
which would have permitted any measures
against them, demanded no other retribution,
than that seventeen, named in a list,
should be declared incapable of holding
offices under the Republic.</p>

<p>One of the best excursions from the
Hague is made to the <i>Maison du Bois</i>, a
small palace of the Prince of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>, in a
wood, which commences almost at the northern
gate of the town. This wood is called
a park, but it is open to the public roads
from Leyden, Haerlem and Amsterdam,
which pass through its noble alleys of oak
and beech. It is remarkable for having
so much attracted the regard of Philip the
Second, that, in the campaign of 1574, he
ordered his officers not to destroy it; and
is probably the only thing, not destined for
himself, of which this ample destroyer of
human kind and of his own family ever
directed the preservation. <span class="smallcaps">Louis</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Fourteenth</span>,
probably having heard the praises
of this care, left the mall of Utrecht to be
a monument of similar tenderness, during
an unprovoked invasion, which cost ten
thousand lives.</p>

<p>The apartments of the <i>Maison du Bois</i> are
very variously furnished. The best are fitted
up with a light grey sattin, imbossed with
Chinese birds and plants, in silk and feathers
of the most beautiful tints; the window curtains,
screens and coverings of the sophas
and chairs are the same, and the frames of
the latter are also of Chinese workmanship.
Nothing more delicate and tasteful can be
conceived; but, that you may not be quite
distracted with admiration, the carpets are
such as an English merchant would scarcely
receive into a parlour. The furniture of the
state bed-chamber is valuable, and has once
been splendid; a light balustrade of curious
Japan work, about three feet high, runs
across the room, and divides that part, in
which the bed stands, from the remainder.
The Princess's drawing-room, in which card
parties are sometimes held, is well embellished
with paintings, and may be called a
superb apartment; but here again there is
an instance of the incompleteness, said to
be observable in the furniture of all rooms,
out of England. Of four card tables two
are odd ones, and literally would be despised
in a broker's shop in London. The great
glory of the house is the <i>Salle d'Orange</i>, an
oblong saloon of noble height, with pannels,
painted by nine celebrated painters of the
Flemish and Dutch schools, among whom
<span class="smallcaps">Van Tulden</span>, a pupil of <span class="smallcaps">Rubens</span>, has
observed his manner so much in a workshop
of Vulcan and in a figure of Venus forming
a trophy, that they have been usually attributed
to his master. The subjects on the
pannels and ceiling are all allegorical, and
complimentary, for the most part, to the
Princes of the House of Orange, especially
to <span class="smallcaps">Frederic Henry</span>, the son of the first
<span class="smallcaps">William</span> and the grandson of the Admiral
<span class="smallcaps">Coligny</span>. It was at the expence of
his widow, that the house was built and the
saloon thus ornamented.</p>

<p>Almost all the rooms are decorated with
family portraits, of which some have just
been contributed by the pencil of the Hereditary
Princess. A large piece represents
herself, taking a likeness of the Princess her
mother-in-law, and includes what is said to
be an admirable portrait of her husband.
On the six doors of the grand cabinet are
six whole lengths of ladies of the House of
Orange, exhibited in allegorical characters.
The doors being covered by the paintings,
when that, by which you have entered, is
shut, you cannot tell the way back again.
A portrait of <span class="smallcaps">Louisa de Coligny</span>, the
widow of William the First, is enriched
with a painter's pun; she is presented by
<i>Hope</i> with a branch of an <i>orange</i> tree, containing
only <i>one</i> orange; from which the
spectator is to learn, that her <i>son</i> was her
<i>only hope</i>.</p>

<p>The most delightful outlet from the Hague
is towards Schevening, a village on the
sea-shore, nearly two miles distant, the road
to which has been often and properly celebrated
as a noble monument of tasteful
grandeur. Commencing at the canal, which
surrounds the Hague, it proceeds to the village
through a vista so exactly straight, that
the steeple of Schevening, the central object
at the end of it, is visible at the first entrance.
Four rows of lofty elms are planted
along the road, of which the two central
lines form this perfect and most picturesque
vista; the others shelter paths on each side
of it, for foot passengers.</p>

<p>The village itself, containing two or three
hundred houses of fishermen and peasants,
would be a spectacle, for its neatness, any
where but in Holland. There is no square,
or street of the most magnificent houses in
London, that can equal it for an universal
appearance of freshness. It is positively
bright with cleanliness; though its only
street opens upon the sea, and is the resort
of hundreds of fishermen. We passed a most
delightful day at a little inn upon the beach,
sometimes looking into the history of the
village, which is very ancient; then enquiring
into its present condition; and then enjoying
the prospect of the ocean, boundless
to our view, on one side, and appearing to
be but feebly restrained by a long tract of
low white coast on the other.</p>

<p>The sea beats furiously upon the beach
here, which has no doubt been much raised
by art for the defence of the village. There
is at least no other way of accounting for
its security, since 1574, between which year
and the latter end of the preceding century,
it sustained six inundations. The first, in
1470, demolished a church; the last washed
away an hundred and twenty houses; notwithstanding
which, the inhabitants built
again upon their stormy shore; and their industry,
that, at length, protected them from
the sea, enabled them to endure also the
more inveterate ravages of the Spaniards.
On this beach lie occasionally great numbers
of herring busses, too stoutly built to be injured
by touching it. We suspect our information
to have been exaggerated; but
we heard on the spot, that no less than one
hundred and five belong to this village of
little more than two hundred houses, or are
managed by agents in it. About forty were
set on float by the tide in the afternoon, and,
being hauled by means of anchors beyond a
very heavy surf, were out of sight, before
we left the place.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the persevering,
effectual, but not very active exertions of
the seamen in this business, which could not
often be more difficult than it then was,
when a strong wind blew directly upon the
shore. We here first perceived, what we
had many other opportunities of observing,
that, notwithstanding the general admiration
of Dutch industry, it is of a nature which
would scarcely acquire that name in England.
A Dutchman of the labouring class is, indeed,
seldom seen unemployed; but we
never observed one man working hard, according
to the English notion of the term.
Perseverance, carefulness, and steadiness are
theirs, beyond any rivalship; the vehemence,
force, activity and impatience of an English
sailor, or workman, are unknown to them.
You will never see a Dutchman enduring
the fatigue, or enjoying the rest, of a London
porter. Heavy burthens, indeed, they
do not carry. At Amsterdam, where
carriages are even somewhat obnoxious, a cask,
holding four or five gallons of liquor, is removed
by a horse and a sledge.</p>

<p>On our way from Schevening, where a
dinner costs more than at an hotel in the
Hague, we turned a little to the right to see
Portland Gardens, once the favourite resort
of William and Mary; and said to be laid
out in the English taste. They are now a
bad specimen even of Dutch gardens. The
situation is unusually low, having on one
hand the raised bank of the Schevening
road, and, on another, the sand hills of the
coast. Between these, the moisture of the
sea air is held for a long time, and finally
drawn down upon the earth. The artificial
ornaments are stained and decaying; and
the grass and weeds of the neglected plots
are capable only of a putrid green. Over
walks of a black mould you are led to the
orangery, where there is more decay, and
may look through the windows of the green-house,
to perceive how every thing is declining
there. Some pavilions, provided with
water spouts, are then to be seen; and, if
you have the patience to wait the conclusion
of an operation, intended to surprise you,
you may count how many of the pipes refuse
to perform their office.</p>

<p>Nearer to the Hague, we were stopped to
pay a toll of a few doights; a circumstance
which was attended with this proof of civility.
Having passed in the morning, without
the demand, we enquired why it should
be made now. The gatherer replied, that he
had seen us pass, but, knowing that we must
return by the same way, had avoided giving
more trouble than was necessary. This tax
is paid for the support of the bank, or digue,
over which the road passes; a work, begun
on the 1st of May 1664, and finished on the
5th of December 1665, by the assistance of
a loan granted for the enterprise. The
breadth of the road is thirty-two yards.</p>

<p>The next day, after seeing the relief of
the Stadtholder's <i>garde du corps</i>, the privates
of which wear feathered hats, with uniforms
of scarlet and gold, we left the Hague,
with much admiration of its pleasantness and
quiet grandeur, and took the <i>roof</i> of the
trechtschuyt for Leyden.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="LEYDEN" id="LEYDEN">LEYDEN.</a></h3>

<p>Three hours pleasant floating along
a canal, adorned with frequent country
houses, gardens, summer-houses and square
balconies, or rather platforms, projecting
over the water, within an hand's breadth of
its level, brought us to this city, which was
esteemed the second in Holland, before Rotterdam
gained its present extent. Leyden is,
however, so large, that a traveller is likely to
have a walk of half a league to his inn; and
those who arrive, as we did, at the time of
the fair, may find the procession not very
pleasant. We increased our difficulties by
turning away from the dirt and incivility of
what was called the best inn, and did not
afterwards find a better, though such, it
seems, might have been had.</p>

<p>Having, at length, become contented with
the worst, we went towards the fair, of
which we had as yet seen only the crowd.
The booths, being disposed under trees and
along the borders of canals, made the whole
appearance differ from that of an English
fair, though not quite so much as we had
expected. The stock of the shopkeepers
makes a greater distinction. There were several
booths filled with silversmiths' and
jewellers' wares, to the amount of, probably,
some thousand pounds each. Large
French clocks in <i>or moulu</i> and porcelain
were among their stores. All the trades displayed
the most valuable articles, that could
be asked for in similar shops in large cities.
We had the pleasure to see great quantities
of English goods, and there were English
names over three, or four of the booths.</p>

<p>The Dutch dresses were now become so
familiar to us, that the crowd seemed as remarkable
for the number of other persons in
it, as for the abundance of peasants in their
holiday finery, which, it is pleasant to know,
displays the ornamental relics of several generations,
fashion having very little influence
in Holland. The fair occupied about
a fourth part of the town, which we soon
left to see the remainder. Two streets, parallel
to each other, run through its whole
length, and include the few public halls of
an University, which would scarcely be
known to exist, if it had no more conspicuous
objects than its buildings. The Dutch
universities contain no endowed foundations;
so that the professors, who have their
salaries from the States, live in private houses,
and the students in lodgings. The academical
dress is worn only in the schools, and
by the professors. The library, to which
Joseph Scaliger was a benefactor, is open
only once in a week, and then for no more
than two hours. It is the constant policy
of the Dutch government, to make strangers
leave as much money as possible behind
them; and Leyden was once so greatly the
resort of foreigners, that it was thought important
not to let them read for nothing
what they must otherwise be obliged to buy.
The University is, of course, declining much,
under this commercial wisdom of the magistrates.</p>

<p>There are students, however, of many
nations and religions, no oaths being imposed,
except upon the professors. Physic
and botany especially are said to be cultivated
here with much success; and there is
a garden, to which not only individuals, but
the East India Company, industriously contribute
foreign plants. The salaries of the
professors, who receive, besides, fees from
the students, are nearly two hundred pounds
a-year. The government of the University
is in the Rector, who is chosen out of three
persons returned by the Senate to the States;
the Senate consists of the professors; and,
on extraordinary occasions, the Senate and
Rector are directed by Curators, who are the
agents for the States.</p>

<p>The chief street in the town is of the
crescent form, so that, with more public
buildings, it would be a miniature resemblance
of High-street, Oxford. The town-house
is built with many spires, and with
almost Chinese lightness. We did not see
the interior of this, or, indeed, of any other
public buildings; for, in the morning, when
curiosity was to be indulged, our fastidiousness
as to the inns returned, and induced us
to take a passage for Haerlem. The MSS.
of the Dutch version of the Bible, which are
known to be deposited here, could not have
been shewn, being opened only once in
three years, when the Deputies of the Synod
and States attend; but we might have seen,
in the town-house, some curious testimonies
of the hardships and perseverance of the inhabitants,
during the celebrated blockade of
five months, in 1574, in consideration of
which the University was founded.</p>

<p>After viewing some well-filled booksellers'
shops, and one wide street of magnificent
houses, we again made half the circuit of
this extensive city, in the way to the trechtschuyt
for</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="HAERLEM" id="HAERLEM">HAERLEM.</a></h3>

<p>The canal between Leyden and this
place is nearly the pleasantest of the great
number, which connect all the towns of the
province with each other, and render them
to the traveller a series of spectacles, almost
as easily visited as the amusements of one
large metropolis. Though this is said to be
one of the lowest parts of Holland, the
country does not appear to have suffered
more than the rest by water. The many
country seats, which border the canals, are
also proofs that it is thought to be well secured;
yet this is the district, which has
been proved, by indisputable observations,
to be lower than the neighbouring sea, even
in the profoundest calm. During the voyage,
which was of four hours, we passed
under several bridges, and saw numbers of
smaller canals, crossing the country in various
directions; but the passage of a trechtschuyt
is not delayed for an instant by a
bridge, the tow-rope being loosened from
the boat, on one side, and immediately
caught again, on the other, if it should not
be delivered by some person, purposely stationed
on the arch. It is not often that a
canal makes any bend in its course; when
it does so, there are small, high posts at the
point, round which the tow-rope is drawn;
and, that the cord may not be destroyed by
the friction, the posts support perpendicular
rollers, which are turned by its motion.
Such posts and rollers might be advantageously
brought into use in England. On
most of the canals are half-way villages,
where passengers may stop, about five minutes,
for refreshment; but they will be left
behind, without any ceremony, if they exceed
the limited time, which the boatman
employs in exchanging letters for such of
the neighbouring country houses as have not
packet boxes placed on the banks.</p>

<p>Haerlem, like Leyden, is fortified by brick
walls, but both seem to be without the solid
earthen works, that constitute the strength
of modern fortresses. A few pieces of cannon
are planted near the gate, in order to
command the bridge of a wide <i>foss&eacute;</i>; and
the gate-house itself is a stout building, deep
enough to render the passage underneath
somewhat dark. There is otherwise very
little appearance of the strength, that resisted
the Duke of Alva, for twelve months,
and exasperated his desire of vengeance so
far, that the murder of the inhabitants, who
at last surrendered to his promises of protection,
could alone appease it.</p>

<p>A narrow street leads from the gate to
the market-place, where two pieces of cannon
are planted before the guard-house;
the first precaution against internal commotion,
which we had seen in the country.
Haerlem had a great share in the disputes
of 1787, and is said to adhere more fully
than any other city to the Anti-Stadtholderian
politics of that period.</p>

<p>The market-place is very spacious, and
surrounds the great church, perhaps, the
largest sacred building in the province of
Holland. The lofty oak roof is marked with
dates of the early part of the sixteenth
century. The organ, sometimes said to be the
best in Europe, is of unusual size, but has
more power of sound than sweetness. The
pipes are silvered, and the body carefully
painted; for organs are the only objects in
Dutch churches, which are permitted to be
shewy. They are now building, in the great
church at Rotterdam, a rival to this instrument,
and need not despair of surpassing it.</p>

<p>A great part of the congregation sit upon
chairs in the large aisle, which does not seem
to be thought a much inferior place to the
other parts. During an evening service, at
which we were present, this was nearly
filled; and while every person took a separate
seat, women carried <i>chauffepieds</i>, or little
wooden boxes, with pans of burning
peat in them, to the ladies. This was on
the 4th of June. The men enter the church
with their hats on, and some wear them,
during the whole service, with the most disgusting
and arrogant hardihood.</p>

<p>We passed a night at Haerlem, which is
scarcely worth so long a stay, though one
street, formed upon the banks of a canal,
consists of houses more uniformly grand,
than any out of the Hague, and surprises
you with its extensive magnificence at a
place, where there is little other appearance
of wealth and none of splendour. But the
quietness of the Great in Holland is daily
astonishing to a stranger, who sometimes
passes through rows of palaces, without
meeting a carriage, or a servant. The inhabitants
of those palaces have, however,
not less earnest views, than they who are
more agitated; the difference between them
is, that the views of the former are only
such as their situation enables them to gratify,
without the agitation of the latter. They
can sit still and wait for the conclusion of
every year, at which they are to be richer,
or rather are to have much more money,
than in the preceding one. They know,
that, every day the silent progress of interest
adds so much to their principal; and they
are content to watch the course of time, for
it is time alone that varies their wealth, the
single object of their attention. There can
be no motive, but its truth, for repeating the
trite opinion of the influence of avarice in
Holland: we expected, perhaps, with some
vanity, to have found an opportunity for
contradicting it; but are able only to add
another testimony of its truth. The infatuation
of loving money not as a means,
but as an end, is paramount in the mind of
almost every Dutchman, whatever may be
his other dispositions and qualities; the addiction
to it is fervent, inveterate, invincible,
and universal from youth to the feeblest
old age.</p>

<p>Haerlem has little trade, its communication
with the sea being through Amsterdam,
which latter place has always been able to
obstruct the reasonable scheme of cutting a
canal through the four miles of land, that
separate the former from the ocean. Its
manufactures of silk and thread are much
less prosperous than formerly. Yet there
are no symptoms of decay, or poverty, and
the environs are well covered with gardens
especially on the banks of the <i>Sparen</i>, of
which one branch flows through the town
and the other passes under the walls. Some
charitable institutions, for the instruction
and employment of children, should be
mentioned also, to assuage the general censure
of a too great fondness for money.</p>

<p>The house of <span class="smallcaps">Laurance Coster</span>, who
is opposed to <span class="smallcaps">Faust</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Gottenburgh</span> and
<span class="smallcaps">Scheffer</span>, for the honour of having invented
the art of printing, is near the great
church and is still inhabited by a bookseller.
An inscription, not worth copying, asserts
him to be the inventor. The house, which
is small and stands in a row with others,
must have received its present brick front in
some time subsequent to that of <span class="smallcaps">Coster</span>.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="AMSTERDAM" id="AMSTERDAM">AMSTERDAM.</a></h3>

<p>The voyage between Haerlem and
this place is less pleasant, with respect to
the country, than many of the other trips,
but more gratifying to curiosity. For great
part of the way, the canal passes between
the lake, called <i>Haerlemer Maer</i>, and a large
branch of the <i>Zuyder Zee</i>, called the River
Y. In one place, the neck of land, which
separates these two waters, is so thin, that a
canal cannot be drawn through it; and,
near this, there is a village, where passengers
leave their first boat, another waiting for
them at the renewal of the canal, within a
quarter of a mile. Here, as upon other
occasions of the same sort, nearly as much is
paid for the carriage of two or three trunks
between the boats, as for the whole voyage;
and there is an <i>Ordonnatie</i> to authorize the
price; for the Magistrates have considered,
that those, who have much baggage, are
probably foreigners, and may be thus made
to support many of the natives. The
Dutch themselves put their linen into a velvet
bag, called a <i>Rysack</i>, and for this accordingly
no charge is made.</p>

<p>The <i>Half Wegen Sluice</i> is the name of
this separation between two vast waters,
both of which have gained considerably
upon their shores, and, if united, would be
irresistible. At the narrowest part, it consists
pile-work and masonry, to the thickness
of probably forty feet. On this spot the
spectator has, on his left hand, the Y,
which, though called a river, is an immense
inundation of the Zuyder Zee, and would
probably carry a small vessel, without interruption,
into the German ocean. On the
other hand, is the Haerlem lake, about
twelve miles long and nine broad, on
which, during the siege of Haerlem, the
Dutch and Spaniards maintained fleets, and
fought battles. Extending as far as Leyden,
there is a passage upon it from that
city to Amsterdam, much shorter than by
the canal, but held to be dangerous. Before
the year 1657, there was, however, no
other way, and it was probably the loss of
the Prince of Bohemia and the danger of
his dethroned father upon the lake, that instigated
the making of the canal.</p>

<p>This sluice is one of several valuable
posts, by which Amsterdam may be defended
against a powerful army, and was an
important station, during the approach of
the Duke of <span class="smallcaps">Brunswick</span> in 1787, when
this city was the last, which surrendered.
All the roads being formed upon dikes, or
embankments, may be defended by batteries,
which can be attacked only by narrow
columns and in front. The Half Wegen
Sluice was, however, easily taken by the
Duke of <span class="smallcaps">Brunswick</span>, his opponents having
neglected to place gun-boats on the Haerlem
lake, over which he carried eight hundred
men in thirty boats, and surprised the
Dutch before day-break, on the morning of
the first of October. This was one of his
real assaults, but there were all together eleven
made on that day, and, on the next,
the city proposed to surrender.</p>

<p>Beyond the sluice, the canal passes several
breaches, made by inundations of the Y,
and not capable of being drained, or repaired.
In these places the canal is separated
from the inundations either by piles, or
floating planks. None of the breaches were
made within the memory of the present
generation, yet the boatmen have learned to
speak of them with horror.</p>

<p>There is nothing magnificent, or grand,
in the approach to Amsterdam, or the
prospect of the city. The sails of above an hundred
windmills, moving on all sides, seem
more conspicuous than the public buildings
of this celebrated capital.</p>

<p>The trechtschuyt having stopped on the
outside of the gate, we waited for one of
the public coaches, which are always to be
had by sending to a livery stable, but do not
stand in the street for fares. It cost half-a-crown
for a drive of about two miles into
the city; the regulated price is a guilder,
or twenty-pence. Our direction was to the
<i>Doolen</i>; but the driver chose to take us to
another inn, in the same street, which we
did not discover to be otherwise called, till
we had become satisfied with it.</p>

<p>Nearly all the chief thorough-fares of
Amsterdam are narrow, but the carriages are
neither so numerous as in other places of
the same size, nor suffered to be driven with
the same speed; so that, though there is no
raised pavement, foot passengers are as safe
as elsewhere. There are broad terraces to
the streets over the two chief canals, but
these are sometimes encumbered by workshops,
placed immediately over the water,
between which and the houses the owners
maintain an intercourse of packages and
planks, with very little care about the freedom
of the passage. This, indeed, may be
constantly observed of the Dutch: they will
never, either in their societies, or their business,
employ their time, for a moment, in
gratifying the little malice, or shewing the
little envy, or assuming the little triumphs,
which fill so much of life with unnecessary
miseries; but they will seldom step one
inch out of their way, or surrender one moment
of their time, to save those, whom
they do not know, from any inconvenience.
A Dutchman, throwing cheeses into his
warehouse, or drawing iron along the path-way,
will not stop, while a lady, or an infirm
person passes, unless he perceives
somebody inclined to protect them; a warehouseman
trundling a cask, or a woman in
the favourite occupation of throwing water
upon her windows, will leave it entirely
to the passengers to take care of their limbs,
or their clothes.</p>

<p>The canals themselves, which are the ornaments
of other Dutch cities, are, for the
most part, the nuisances of Amsterdam.
Many of them are entirely stagnant, and,
though deep, are so laden with filth, that,
on a hot day, the feculence seems pestilential.
Our windows opened upon two, but
the scent very soon made us willing to relinquish
the prospect. The bottoms are so
muddy, that a boat-hook, drawn up, perhaps,
through twelve feet of water, leaves a
circle of slime at the top, which is not lost
for many minutes. It is not unusual to see
boats, laden with this mud, passing during
mid-day, under the windows of the most
opulent traders; and the fetid cargoes never
disturb the intense studies of the counting-houses
within.</p>

<p>After this distaste of the streets and canals
of Amsterdam, it was a sort of duty to see,
what is the glory of the city, the interior
of the Stadthouse; but we lost this spectacle,
by a negligence of that severe punctuality,
in which the Dutch might be usefully
imitated throughout the world. Our
friends had obtained for us a ticket of admission
at ten; we called upon them about
half an hour afterwards; but, as the ride
from their house would have required ten
minutes more, the time of this ticket was
thought to be elapsed. We would not accept
one, which was offered to be obtained
for another day, being unwilling to render
it possible, that those, who were loading us
with the sincerest civilities, should witness
another apparent instance of inattention.</p>

<p>The Stadthouse, as to its exterior, is a
plain stone building, attracting attention
chiefly from its length, solidity and height.
The front is an hundred and eight paces
long. It has no large gate, but several small
ones, and few statues, that would be observed,
except one of Atlas on the top.
The tales, as to the expence of the building,
are inexhaustible. The foundation alone,
which is entirely of piles, is said to
have cost a million of guilders, or nearly
ninety thousand pounds, and the whole edifice
treble that sum. Its contents, the stock
of the celebrated Bank, are estimated at
various amounts, of which we will not repeat
the lowest.</p>

<p>The Exchange is an humble building,
and not convenient of access. The Post
Office is well situated, upon a broad terrace,
near the Stadthouse, and seems to be properly
laid out for its use.</p>

<p>None of the churches are conspicuous for
their structure; but the regulation, with
respect to their ministers, should be more
known. Two are assigned to each, and
all throughout the city have equal and respectable
salaries.</p>

<p>At a distance from the Exchange are
some magnificent streets, raised on the banks
of canals, nearly equalling those of the
Hague for the grandeur of houses, and
much exceeding in length the best of Leyden
and Haerlem. These are the streets,
which must give a stranger an opinion of
the wealth of the city, while the Port, and
that alone, can display the extensiveness of
its commerce. The shops and the preparations
for traffic in the interior have a
mean appearance to those, who try them
by the standard of London conveniences
and elegance.</p>

<p>The best method of seeing the Port is to
pass down it in a boat to some of the
many towns, that skirt the Zuyder Zee.
One convenience, easy to be had every
where, is immediately visible from the
quays. Small platforms of planks supported
by piles project from the shore between the
vessels, which are disposed with their heads
towards the sides of these little bridges;
the furthest has thus a communication with
the quay, and, if the cargo is not of very
heavy articles, may be unladen at the same
time with the others. The port is so wide,
that, though both sides are thronged with
shipping, the channel in the middle is, at
least, as broad as the Thames at London
Bridge; but the harbour does not extend to
more than half the length of the <i>Pool</i> at
London, and seems to contain about half
the number of vessels. The form of the
port is, however, much more advantageous
for a display of shipping, which may be
here seen nearly at one glance in a fine bay
of the <i>Zuyder</i>.</p>

<p>After a sail of about an hour, we landed
at Saardam, a village celebrated for the
Dockyards, which supply Amsterdam with
nearly all its fleets. A short channel carries
vessels of the greatest burthen from Saardam
to the Zuyder Zee, which the founders of
the place took care not to approach too
nearly; and the terrace at the end of this
channel is prepared for the reception of
cannon, that must easily defend it from any
attack by sea. Though the neighbourhood
of a dockyard might be supposed a sufficient
antidote to cleanliness, the neatness of
this little town renders it a spectacle even
to the Dutch themselves. The streets are
so carefully swept, that a piece of orange
peel would be noticed upon the pavement,
and the houses are washed and painted to
the highest polish of nicety. Those, who
are here in a morning, or at night, may
probably see how many dirty operations are
endured for the sake of this excessive cleanliness.</p>

<p>We were shewn nearly round the place,
and, of course, to the cottage, in which the
indefatigable Peter the First of Russia resided,
when he was a workman in the dockyard.
It is a tenement of two rooms,
standing in a part of the village, so very
mean, that the alleys near it are not cleaner,
than those of other places. An old woman
lives in the cottage, and subsists chiefly by
shewing it to visitors, amongst whom have
been the present Grand Duke and Duchess
of Russia; for the Court of Petersburgh
acknowledge it to have been the residence
of Peter, and have struck a medal in commemoration
of so truly honourable a palace.
The old woman has received one of these
medals from the present Empress, together
with a grant of a small annuity to encourage
her care of the cottage.</p>

<p>We passed an agreeable afternoon, at an
inn on the terrace, from whence pleasure
vessels and passage boats were continually
departing for Amsterdam, and had a smart
sail, on our return, during a cloudy and
somewhat a stormy sunset. The approach
to Amsterdam, on this side, is as grand as
that from Haerlem is mean, half the circuit
of the city, and all its spires, being visible at
once over the crowded harbour. The great
church of Haerlem is also seen at a small
distance, on the right. The Amstel, a wide
river, which flows through the city into the
harbour, fills nearly all the canals, and is
itself capable of receiving ships of considerable
burthen: one of the bridges over it, and
a terrace beyond, are among the few pleasant
walks enjoyed by the inhabitants. The
Admiralty, an immense building, in the interior
of which is the dockyard, stands on
this terrace, or quay; and the East India
Company have their magazine here, instead
of the interior of the city, where it would
be benevolence to let its perfume counteract
the noxiousness of the canals.</p>

<p>The government of Amsterdam is said to
collect by taxes, rents and dues of various
sorts, more than an English million and a
half annually; and, though a great part of
this sum is afterwards paid to the use of the
whole Republic, the power of collecting
and distributing it must give considerable
consequence to the magistrates. The Senate,
which has this power, consists of
thirty-six members, who retain their seats
during life, and were formerly chosen by
the whole body of burghers; but, about
two centuries ago, this privilege was surrendered
to the Senate itself, who have ever
since filled up the vacancies in their number
by a majority of their own voices. The
<i>Echevins</i>, who form the court of justice,
are here chosen by the burghers out of a
double number, nominated by the Senate:
in the other cities, the Stadtholder, and not
the burghers, makes this choice.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that when the City Senates,
which return the Provincial States, and,
through them, the States General, were
themselves elected by the burghers, the
legislature of the United Provinces had a
character entirely representative; and, at
present, a respect for public opinion is said
to have considerable influence in directing
the choice of the Senates.</p>

<p>The province of Holland, of which this
city is the most important part, is supposed
to contain 800,000 persons, who pay taxes
to the amount of twenty-four millions of
guilders, or two millions sterling, forming
an average of two pounds ten shillings per
person. In estimating the real taxation of
a people, it is, however, necessary to consider
the proportion of their consumption to
their imports; for the duties, advanced upon
imported articles, are not ultimately and
finally paid till these are consumed. The
frugal habits of the Dutch permit them to
retain but a small part of the expensive
commodities, which they collect; and the
foreigners, to whom they are resold, pay,
therefore, a large share of the taxation,
which would be so enormous, if it was confined
to the inhabitants. Among the taxes,
really paid by themselves, are the following;&mdash;a land-tax
of about four shillings and nine
pence per acre; a sale-tax of eight per cent.
upon horses, one and a quarter per cent.
upon other moveables, and two and an half
per cent. upon land and buildings; a tax
upon inheritances out of the direct line,
varying from two and an half to eleven per
cent.; two per cent. upon every man's income;
an excise of three pounds per hogshead
upon wine, and a charge of two per
cent. upon all public offices. The latter
tax is not quite so popular here as in other
countries, because many of these offices are
actually purchased, the holders being compelled
to buy stock to a certain amount, and
to destroy the obligations. The excise upon
coffee, tea and salt is paid annually by
each family, according to the number of
their servants.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Amsterdam, and some
other cities, pay also a tax, in proportion to
their property, for the maintenance of companies
of city-guards, which are under the
orders of their own magistrates. In Amsterdam,
indeed, taxation is somewhat higher
than in other places. Sir William Temple
was assured, that no less than thirty
duties might be reckoned to have been paid
there, before a certain dish could be placed
upon a table at a tavern.</p>

<p>The exact sums, paid by the several
provinces towards every hundred thousand
guilders, raised for the general use, have
been often printed. The share of Holland
is 58,309 guilders and a fraction; that of
Overyssel, which is the smallest, 3571 guilders
and a fraction.</p>

<p>Of five colleges of Admiralty, established
within the United Provinces, three are in
Holland, and contribute of course to point
out the pre-eminence of that province. It
is remarkable, that neither of these supply
their ships with provisions: They allow the
captains to deduct about four-pence halfpenny
per day from the pay of each sailor
for that purpose; a regulation, which is
never made injurious to the seamen by any
improper parsimony, and is sometimes useful
to the public, in a country where pressing
is not permitted. A captain, who has
acquired a character for generosity amongst
the sailors, can muster crew in a few days,
which, without such a temptation, could
not be raised in as many weeks.</p>

<p>We cannot speak with exactness of the
prices of provisions in this province, but
they are generally said to be as high as in
England. The charges at inns are the same
as on the roads within an hundred miles of
London, or, perhaps, something more. Port
wine is not so common as a wine which
they call Claret, but which is compounded
of a strong red wine from Valencia, mixed
with some from Bourdeaux. The general
price for this is twenty pence English a
bottle; three and four pence is the price
for a much better sort. About half-a-crown
per day is charged for each apartment;
and <i>logement</i> is always the first article in
a bill.</p>

<p>Private families buy good claret at the
rate of about eighteen pence per bottle,
and chocolate for two shillings per pound.
Beef is sold for much less than in England,
but is so poor that the Dutch use it chiefly
for soup, and salt even that which they
roast. Good white sugar is eighteen pence
per pound. Bread is dearer than in England;
and there is a sort, called milk bread,
of uncommon whiteness, which costs nearly
twice as much as our ordinary loaves.
Herbs and fruits are much lower priced,
and worse in flavour; but their colour and
size are not inferior. Fish is cheaper than
in our maritime counties, those excepted
which are at a great distance from the metropolis.
Coffee is very cheap, and is more
used than tea. No kind of meat is so good
as in England; but veal is not much inferior,
and is often dressed as plainly and as
well as with us. The innkeepers have a
notion of mutton and lamb chops; but
then it is <i>&agrave; la Maintenon</i>; and the rank oil
of the paper is not a very delightful sauce.
Butter is usually brought to table <i>clarified</i>,
that is, purposely melted into an <i>oil</i>; and
it is difficult to make them understand that
it may be otherwise.</p>

<p>The Dutch have much more respect for
English than for other travellers; but there
is a jealousy, with respect to our commerce,
which is avowed by those, who have
been tutored to calm discussion, and may
be perceived in the conversation of others,
whenever the state of the two countries is
noticed. This jealousy is greater in the
maritime than in the other provinces, and
in Amsterdam than in some of the other cities.
Rotterdam has so much direct intercourse
with England, as to feel, in some
degree, a share in its interests.</p>

<p>Some of our excursions round Amsterdam
were made in a curious vehicle; the
body of a coach placed upon a sledge, and
drawn by one horse. The driver walks by
the side, with the reins in one hand, and
in the other a wetted rope, which he sometimes
throws under the sledge to prevent it
from taking fire, and to fill up the little
gaps in the pavement. The appearance of
these things was so whimsical, that curiosity
tempted us to embark in one; and, finding
them laughed at by none but ourselves, the
convenience of being upon a level with the
shops, and with the faces that seemed to
contain the history of the shops, induced us
to use them again. There are great numbers
of them, being encouraged by the magistrates,
in preference to wheel carriages,
and, as is said, in tenderness to the piled
foundations of the city, the only one in
Holland in which they are used. The price
is eight pence for any distance within the
city, and eight pence an hour for attendance.</p>

<p>Near Amsterdam is the small village of
Ouderkirk, a place of some importance in
the short campaign of 1787, being accessible
by four roads, all of which were then fortified.
It consists chiefly of the country
houses of Amsterdam merchants, at one of
which we passed a pleasant day. Having
been but slightly defended, after the loss of
the posts of <i>Half Wegen</i> and <i>Amstelveen</i>, it
was not much injured by the Prussians; but
there are many traces of balls thrown into
it. The ride to it from Amsterdam is upon
the chearful banks of the Amstel, which is
bordered, for more than five miles, with
gardens of better verdure and richer groves
than had hitherto appeared. The village
was spread with booths for a fair, though
it was Sunday; and we were somewhat
surprised to observe, that a people in general
so gravely decorous as the Dutch, should
not pay a stricter deference to the Sabbath.
We here took leave of some friends, whose
frank manners and obliging dispositions are
remembered with much more delight than
any other circumstances, relative to Amsterdam.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="UTRECHT" id="UTRECHT">UTRECHT.</a></h3>

<p>The passage from Amsterdam hither
is of eight hours; and, notwithstanding the
pleasantness of trechtschuyt conveyance,
seemed somewhat tedious, after the habit of
passing from city to city in half that time.
The canal is, however, justly preferred to
others, on account of the richness of its
surrounding scenery; and it is pleasing to
observe how gradually the country improves,
as the distance from the province of Holland
and from the sea increases. Towards
Utrecht, the gardens rise from the banks of
the canal, instead of spreading below its
level, and the grounds maintain avenues and
plantations of lofty trees. Vegetation is
stronger and more copious; shrubs rise to a
greater height; meadows display a livelier
green; and the lattice-work of the bowery
avenues, which occur so frequently, ceases
to be more conspicuous than the foliage.</p>

<p>It was Whitsuntide, and the banks of
the canal were gay with holiday people,
riding in waggons and carts; the latter frequently
carrying a woman wearing a painted
hat as large as an umbrella, and a man
with one in whimsical contrast clipped nearly
close to the crown. The lady
sometimes refreshed herself with a fan, and the
gentleman, meanwhile, with a pipe of tobacco.
Every village we passed resounded
with hoarse music and the clatter of wooden
shoes: among these the prettiest was <i>Nieuversluys</i>,
bordering each side of the canal,
with a white drawbridge picturesquely
shadowed with high trees, and green banks
sloping to the water's brim. Pleasure-boats
and trechtschuyts lined the shores; and the
windows of every house were thronged with
broad faces. On the little terraces below
were groups of smokers, and of girls in the
neat trim Dutch dress, with the fair complexion
and air of decorous modesty, by
which their country-women are distinguished.</p>

<p>About half way from Amsterdam stands
a small modern fortification; and it is an
instance of Dutch carefulness, that grass had
just been mowed even from the parapets of
the batteries, and was made up in heaps
within the works. Not far from it is an
ancient castle of one tower, left in the state
to which it was reduced during the contest
with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Near Utrecht, the ground has improved
so much, that nothing but its evenness distinguishes
it from other countries; and, at
some distance eastward, the hills of Guelderland
rise to destroy this last difference.
The entrance into the city is between high
terraces, from which steps descend to the
canal; but the street is not wide enough to
have its appearance improved by this sort
of approach. Warehouses, formed under
the terraces, shew also that the latter have
been raised more for convenience than
splendour.</p>

<p>The steeple of the great church, formerly
a cathedral, excites, in the mean time, an
expectation of dignity in the interior, where
some considerable streets and another canal
complete the air of an opulent city. It is
not immediately seen, that a great part of the
body of this cathedral has been destroyed,
and that the canals, being subject to tides,
have dirty walls during the ebb. The
splendour, which might be expected in the
capital of a province much inhabited by nobility,
does not appear; nor is there, perhaps,
any street equal to the best of Leyden
and Haerlem; yet, in general beauty, the
city is superior to either of these.</p>

<p>We arrived just before nine, at which
hour a bell rings to denote the shutting of
the larger gates; for the rules of a walled
town are observed here, though the fortifications
could be of little other use than to
prevent a surprise by horse. The <i>Chateau
d'Anvers</i>, at which we lodged, is an excellent
inn, with a landlord, who tells, that he
has walked sixty years in his own passage,
and that he had the honour of entertaining
the Marquis of Granby thirteen times,
during the war of 1756. Though the Dutch
inns are generally unobjectionable, there is
an air of English completeness about this
which the others do not reach.</p>

<p>Utrecht is an university, but with as little
appearance of such an institution as Leyden.
The students have no academical dress;
and their halls, which are used only for lectures
and exercises, are formed in the cloisters
of the ancient cathedral. The chief
sign of their residence in the place is, that
the householders, who have lodgings to let,
write upon a board, as is done at Leyden,
<i>Cubicula locanda</i>. We were shewn round
the town by a member of the university,
who carefully avoided the halls; and we did
not press to see them.</p>

<p>There are still some traces remaining of
the Bishopric, which was once so powerful,
as to excite the jealousy, or rather, perhaps,
to tempt the avarice of Charles the Fifth,
who seized upon many of its possessions.
The use made of the remainder by the
States General, is scarcely more justifiable;
for the prebends still subsist, and are disposed
of by sale to Lay Canons, who send
delegates to the Provincial States, as if they
had ecclesiastical characters.</p>

<p>The substantial remains of the Cathedral
are one aisle, in which divine service is
performed, and a lofty, magnificent Gothic
tower, that stands apart from it. The ascent
of this tower is one of the tasks prescribed
to strangers, and, laborious as it is, the view
from the summit sufficiently rewards them.
A stone staircase, steep, narrow, and winding,
after passing several grated doors, leads
into a floor, which you hope is at the top,
but which is little more than half way up.
Here the family of the belfryman fill several
decently furnished apartments, and shew the
great bell, with several others, the noise of
which, it might be supposed, no human ears
could bear, as they must, at the distance of
only three, or four yards. After resting a
few minutes in a room, the windows of
which command, perhaps, a more extensive
land view than any other inhabited apartment
in Europe, you begin the second ascent
by a staircase still narrower and steeper,
and, when you seem to be so weary as to
be incapable of another step, half the horizon
suddenly bursts upon the view, and all
your meditated complaints are overborne by
expressions of admiration.</p>

<p>Towards the west, the prospect, after including
the rich plain of gardens near
Utrecht, extends over the province of Holland,
intersected with water, speckled with
towns, and finally bounded by the sea, the
mists of which hide the low shores from the
sight. To the northward, the Zuyder Zee
spreads its haziness over Amsterdam and
Naerden; but from thence to the east, the
spires of Amersfoort, Rhenen, Arnheim,
Nimeguen and many intermediate towns,
are seen amongst the woods and hills, that
gradually rise towards Germany. South-ward,
the more mountainous district of
Cleves and then the level parts of Guelderland
and Holland, with the windings of the
Waal and the Leck, in which the Rhine
loses itself, complete a circle of probably
more than sixty miles diameter, that strains
the sight from this tremendous steeple. The
almost perpendicular view into the streets
of Utrecht affords afterwards some relief to
the eye, but increases any notions of danger,
you may have had from observing,
that the open work Gothic parapet, which
alone prevents you from falling with dizziness,
has suffered something in the general
decay of the church.</p>

<p>While we were at the top, the bells
struck; and, between the giddiness communicated
by the eye, and the stunning effect
of a sound that seemed to shake the steeple,
we were compelled to conclude sooner than
had been intended this comprehensive and
farewell prospect of Holland.</p>

<p>The Mall, which is esteemed the chief
ornament of Utrecht, is, perhaps, the only
avenue of the sort in Europe, still fit to be
used for the game that gives its name to
them all. The several rows of noble trees
include, at the sides, roads and walks; but
the centre is laid out for the game of <i>Mall</i>,
and, though not often used, is in perfect
preservation. It is divided so as to admit
of two parties of players at once, and the
side-boards sufficiently restrain spectators.
The Mall in St. James's Park was kept in
the same state, till 1752, when the present
great walk was formed over the part, which
was separated by similar side-boards. The
length of that at Utrecht is nearly three
quarters of a mile. The luxuriance and
loftiness of the trees preserve a perspective
much superior to that of St. James's, but in
the latter the whole breadth of the walks is
greater, and the view is more extensive, as
well as more ornamented.</p>

<p>This city, being a sort of capital to the
neighbouring nobility, is called the politest
in the United Provinces, and certainly abounds,
more than the others, with the professions
and trades, which are subservient to
splendour. One practice, observed in some
degree, in all the cities, is most frequent
here; that of bows paid to all parties, in
which there are ladies, by every gentleman
who passes. There are, however, no plays,
or other public amusements; and the festivities,
or ceremonies, by which other nations
commemorate the happier events in their
history, are as unusual here as in the other
parts of the United Provinces, where there
are more occasions to celebrate and fewer
celebrations than in most European countries.
Music is very little cultivated in any
of the cities, and plays are to be seen only
at Amsterdam and the Hague, where German
and Dutch pieces are acted upon alternate
nights. At Amsterdam, a French
Opera-house has been shut up, and, at the
Hague, a <i>Com&eacute;die</i>, and the actors ordered
to leave the country.</p>

<p>The ramparts of the city, which are high
and command extensive prospects, are rather
emblems of the peacefulness, which it
has long enjoyed, than signs of any effectual
resistance, prepared for an enemy.
They are in many places regularly planted
with trees, which must be old enough to
have been spared, together with the Mall,
by Louis the Fourteenth; in others, pleasure
houses, instead of batteries, have been
raised upon them. A few pieces of old
cannon are planted for the purpose of saluting
the Prince of <span class="smallcaps">Orange</span>, when he passes
the city.</p>

<p>Trechtschuyts go no further eastward
than this place, so that we hired a
voiturier's carriage, a sort of curricle with a driver's
box in front, for the journey to Nimeguen.
The price for thirty-eight, or
thirty-nine miles, was something more than
a guinea and a half; the horses were worth
probably sixty pounds upon the spot, and
were as able as they were showy, or they
could not have drawn us through the deep
sands, that cover one third of the road.</p>

<p>We were now speedily quitting almost
every thing, that is generally characteristic
of Dutch land. The pastures were intermixed
with fields of prosperous corn; the
best houses were surrounded by high woods,
and the grounds were separated by hedges,
instead of water, where any sort of partition
was used. Windmills were seldom seen, and
those only for corn. But these improvements
in the appearance of the country
were accompanied by many symptoms of
a diminished prosperity among the people.
In eight-and-thirty miles there was not one
considerable town; a space, which, in the
province of Holland, would probably have
included three opulent cities, several extensive
villages, and ranges of mansions, erected
by merchants and manufacturers.</p>

<p><i>Wyk de Duerstede</i>, the first town in the
road, is distinguishable at some distance, by
the shattered tower of its church, a monument
of the desolation, spread by the
Spaniards. The inhabitants, probably intending,
that it should remain as a lesson
to posterity, have not attempted to restore
it, further than to place some stones over
the part filled by the clock. The body of
the church and the remainder of the tower
are not deficient of Gothic dignity. The
town itself consists of one, or two wide
streets, not well filled either with inhabitants,
or houses.</p>

<p>The road here turns to the eastward and
is led along the right bank of the Leck,
one of the branches of the Rhine, upon a
raised mound, or dique, sometimes twenty,
or thirty feet, above the river on the one
side, and the plains, on the other. Small
posts, each numbered, are placed along this
road, at unequal distances, for no other use,
which we could discover, than to enable
the surveyors to report exactly where the
mound may want repairs. The carriage
way is formed of a deep sand, which we
were very glad to leave, by crossing the river
at a ferry; though this road had given us a
fine view of its course and of some stately
vessels, pressing against the stream, on their
voyage to Germany.</p>

<p>On the other side, the road went further
from the river, though we continued to skirt
it occasionally as far as a small ferry-house,
opposite to Rhenen, at which we dined,
while the horses rested under a shed, built
over the road, as weigh-houses are at our
turnpikes. Rhenen is a walled town, built
upon an ascent from the water, and appears
to have two, or three neat streets.</p>

<p>Having dined in a room, where a table,
large enough for twenty persons, was placed,
on one side, and a line of four, or five beds,
covered by one long curtain, was formed
against the wainscot, on the other, the
voiturier clamoured, that the gates of Nimeguen
would be shut before we could get to
them, and we soon began to cross the country
between the Leck and the Waal, another
branch of the Rhine, which, in Guelderland,
divides itself into so many channels,
that none can be allowed the pre-eminence
of retaining its name. Soon after reaching
the right bank of the Waal, the road affords
a view of the distant towers of Nimeguen,
which appear there to be very important,
standing upon a brow, that seems to front
the whole stream of the river. In the way,
we passed several noble estates, with
mansions, built in the castellated form, which
James the First introduced into England,
instead of the more fortified residences; and
there was a sufficient grandeur of woods
and avenues, to shew, that there might be
parks, if the owners had the taste to form
them. Between the avenues, the gilded ornaments
of the roof, and the peaked coverings,
placed, in summer, over the chimneys,
glittered to the light, and shewed the fantastic
style of the architecture, so exactly
copied in Flemish landscapes of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>As the sun declined and we drew near
Nimeguen, the various colouring of a scene
more rich than extensive rendered its effect
highly interesting. The wide Waal on our
left, reflecting the evening blush, and a vessel
whose full sails caught a yellow gleam
from the west; the ramparts and pointed
roofs of Nimeguen rising over each other,
just tinted by the vapour that ascended from
the bay below; the faint and fainter blue of
two ridges of hills in Germany retiring in
the distance, with the mellow green of
nearer woods and meadows, formed a combination
of hues surprisingly gay and beautiful.
But Nimeguen lost much of its dignity
on a nearer approach; for many of
the towers, which the treachery of fancy
had painted at distance, changed into forms
less picturesque; and its situation, which a
bold sweep of the Waal had represented to
be on a rising peninsula crowning the flood,
was found to be only on a steep beside it.
The ramparts, however, the high old tower
of the citadel, the Belvidere, with the southern
gate of the town beneath, composed
part of an interesting picture on the opposite
margin of the river. But there was
very little time to observe it: the driver saw
the flying bridge, making its last voyage,
for the night, towards our shore, and likely
to return in about twenty minutes; he,
therefore, drove furiously along the high
bank of the river, and, turning the angle
of the two roads with a velocity, which
would have done honour to a Brentford
postillion, entered that adjoining the first
half of the bridge, and shewed the directors
of the other half, that we were to be
part of their cargo.</p>

<p>This bridge, which is partly laid over
boats and partly over two barges, that float
from the boats to the shore, is so divided,
because the stream is occasionally too rapid
to permit an entire range of boats between
the two banks. It is thus, for one half, a
bridge of boats, and, for the other, a flying
bridge; which last part is capable of containing
several carriages, and joins to the
other so exactly as not to occasion the least
interruption. It is also railed for the safety
of foot passengers, of whom there are commonly
twenty, or thirty. The price for a
carriage is something about twenty-pence,
which the tollmen carefully collect as soon
as the demi-bridge has begun its voyage.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="NIMEGUEN" id="NIMEGUEN">NIMEGUEN</a></h3>

<p>Has, towards the water, little other
fortification than an ancient brick wall, and
a gate. Though it is a garrison town, and
certainly no trifling object, we were not
detained at the gate by troublesome ceremonies.
The commander, affecting no unnecessary
carefulness, is satisfied with a copy
of the report, which the innkeepers, in all
the towns, send to the Magistrates, of the
names and conditions of their guests. A
printed paper is usually brought up, after
supper, in which you are asked to write
your name, addition, residence, how long
you intend to stay, and to whom you are
known in the province. We did not shew
a passport in Holland.</p>

<p>The town has an abrupt but short elevation
from the river, which you ascend by a
narrow but clean street, opening into a spacious
market-place. The great church and
the guard-house are on one side of this;
from the other, a street runs to the eastern
gate of the town, formed in the old wall,
beyond which commence the modern and
strong fortifications, that defend it, on the
land side. At the eastern extremity of the
place, a small mall leads to the house, in
which the Prince of Orange resided, during
the troubles of 1786; and, beyond it, on a
sudden promontory towards the river, stands
a prospect house, called the Belvidere,
which, from its eastern and southern windows,
commands a long view into Germany,
and to the north looks over Guelderland.
From this place all the fortifications,
which are very extensive, are plainly seen,
and a military person might estimate their
strength. There are several forts and
outworks, and, though the ditch is pallisadoed
instead of filled, the place must be capable
of a considerable defence, unless the besieging
army should be masters of the river and
the opposite bank. There was formerly a
fortress upon this bank, which was often
won and lost, during the sieges of Nimeguen,
but no remains of it are visible now.</p>

<p>The town is classic ground to those, who
venerate the efforts, by which the provinces
were rescued from the dominion of the
Spaniards. It was first attempted by <span class="smallcaps">Sengius</span>,
a Commander in the Earl of <span class="smallcaps">Leicester's</span>
army, who proposed to enter it,
at night, from the river, through a house,
which was to be opened to him; but his
troops by mistake entered another, where a
large company was collected, on occasion
of a wedding, and, being thus discovered to
the garrison, great numbers of those, already
landed upon the beach, were put to
the sword, or drowned in the confusion of
the retreat. An attempt by Prince Maurice
to surprise it was defeated by the failure of
a <i>petard</i>, applied to one of the gates; but it
was soon after taken by a regular siege, carried
on chiefly from the other side of the
river. This and the neighbouring fortress
of Grave were among the places, first taken
by Louis the Fourteenth, during his invasion,
having been left without sufficient
garrisons.</p>

<p>The citadel, a remnant of the antient
fortifications, is near the eastern gate, which
appears to be thought stronger than the
others, for, on this side, also is the arsenal.</p>

<p>Nimeguen has been compared to Nottingham,
which it resembles more in situation
than in structure, though many of the
streets are steep, and the windows of one
range of houses sometimes overlook the
chimnies of another; the views also, as from
some parts of Nottingham, are over a green
and extensive level, rising into distant hills;
and here the comparison ends. The houses
are built entirely in the Dutch fashion, with
many coloured, painted fronts, terminating
in peaked roofs; but some decline of neatness
may be observed by those who arrive
here from the province of Holland. The
market-place, though gay and large, cannot
be compared with that of Nottingham, in
extent, nor is the town more than half the
size of the latter, though it is said to contain
nearly fifty thousand inhabitants. From
almost every part of it you have, however,
a glimpse of the surrounding landscape,
which is more extensive than that seen from
Nottingham, and is adorned by the sweeps
of a river of much greater dignity than the
Trent.</p>

<p>We left Nimeguen, in the afternoon,
with a voiturier, whose price, according
to the <i>ordonnatie</i>, was higher than if we
had set out half an hour sooner, upon the
supposition that he could not return that
night. The road lies through part of the
fortifications, concerning which there can,
of course, be no secrecy. It then enters an
extensive plain, and runs almost parallel to
a range of heights, at the extremity of
which Nimeguen stands, and presents an
appearance of still greater strength and importance
than when seen from the westward.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>After a few miles, this road leaves the
territories of the United Provinces, and
enters the Prussian duchy of Cleves, at a
spot where a mill is in one country, and
the miller's house in the other. An instance
of difference between the conditions
of the people in the two countries was observable
even at this passage of their boundary.
Our postillion bought, at the miller's,
a loaf of black bread, such as is not
made in the Dutch provinces, and carried
it away for the food of his horses, which
were thus initiated into some of the blessings
of the German peasantry. After another
quarter of a mile you have more proofs that
you have entered the country of the King
of Prussia. From almost every cluster of huts
barefooted children run out to beg, and ten
or a dozen stand at every gate, nearly throwing
themselves under the wheels to catch
your money, which, every now and then,
the bigger seize from the less.</p>

<p>Yet the land is not ill-cultivated. The
distinction between the culture of land in
free and arbitrary countries, was, indeed,
never very apparent to us, who should have
been ready enough to perceive it. The
great landholders know what should be
done, and the peasantry are directed to do
it. The latter are, perhaps, supplied with
stock, and the grounds produce as much as
elsewhere, though you may read, in the
looks and manners of the people, that very
little of its productions is for them.</p>

<p>Approaching nearer to Cleves, we travelled
on a ridge of heights, and were once
more cheared with the "pomp of groves."
Between the branches were delightful catches
of extensive landscapes, varied with hills
clothed to their summits with wood, where
frequently the distant spires of a town peeped
out most picturesquely. The open vales
between were chiefly spread with corn;
and such a prospect of undulating ground,
and of hills tufted with the grandeur of
forests, was inexpressibly chearing to eyes
fatigued by the long view of level countries.</p>

<p>At a few miles from Cleves the road enters
the Park and a close avenue of noble
plane-trees, when these prospects are, for a
while, excluded. The first opening is
where, on one hand, a second avenue commences,
and, on the other, a sort of broad
bay in the woods, which were planted by
Prince Maurice, includes an handsome house
now converted into an inn, which, owing
to the pleasantness of the situation, and its
vicinity to a mineral spring, is much frequented
in summer. A statue of General
Martin Schenck, of dark bronze, in complete
armour, and with the beaver down,
is raised upon a lofty Ionic column, in the
centre of the avenue, before the house.
Resting upon a lance, the figure seems to
look down upon the passenger, and to
watch over the scene, with the sternness of
an ancient knight. It appears to be formed
with remarkable skill, and has an air more
striking and grand than can be readily described.</p>

<p>The <i>orangerie</i> of the palace is still preserved,
together with a semi-circular pavilion,
in a recess of the woods, through
which an avenue of two miles leads you to</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="X-CLEVES" id="X-CLEVES">CLEVES.</a></h3>

<p>This place, which, being the capital
of a duchy, is entitled a City, consists of
some irregular streets, built upon the brow
of a steep hill. It is walled, but cannot be
mentioned as fortified, having no solid
works. The houses are chiefly built of
stone, and there is a little of Dutch cleanliness;
but the marks of decay are strongly
impressed upon them, and on the ancient
walls. What little trade there is, exists in
retailing goods sent from Holland. The
Dutch language and coins are in circulation
here, almost as much as the German.</p>

<p>The established religion of the town is
Protestant; but here is an almost universal
toleration, and the Catholics have several
churches and monasteries. Cleves has suffered
a various fate in the sport of war
during many centuries, but has now little
to distinguish it except the beauty of its
prospects, which extend into Guelderland
and the province of Holland, over a country
enriched with woody hills and vallies of
corn and pasturage.</p>

<p>Being convinced, in two or three hours,
that there was nothing to require a longer
stay, we set out for Xanten, a town in the
same duchy, distant about eighteen miles.
For nearly the whole of this length the
road lay through a broad avenue, which
frequently entered a forest of oak, fir, elm,
and majestic plane-trees, and emerged from
it only to wind along its skirts. The views
then opened over a country, diversified with
gentle hills, and ornamented by numberless
spires upon the heights, every small
town having several convents. The castle
of Eltenberg, on the summit of a wooded
mountain, was visible during the whole of
this stage and part of the next day's
journey. Yet the fewness, or the poverty, of
the inhabitants appeared from our meeting
only one chaise, and two or three small carts,
for eighteen miles of the only high-road
in the country.</p>

<p>It was a fine evening in June, and the
rich lights, thrown among the forest glades,
with the solitary calmness of the scene, and
the sereneness of the air, filled with scents
from the woods, were circumstances which
persuaded to such tranquil rapture as Collins
must have felt when he had the happiness
to address to Evening&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
For when thy folding star, arising, shews<br />
His paly circlet, at his warning lamp,<br />
The fragrant hours and elves<br />

<br />
And many a nymph, who wreaths her brows with sedge,<br />
And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and, lovelier still,<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>A small half-way village, a stately convent,
with its gardens, called Marienbaum,
founded in the 15th century by Maria,
Duchess of Cleves, and a few mud cottages
of the woodcutters, were the only
buildings on the road: the foot passengers
were two Prussian soldiers. It was moonlight,
and we became impatient to reach
Xanten, long before our driver could say,
in a mixture of German and Dutch, that
we were near it. At length from the
woods, that had concealed the town, a few
lights appeared over the walls, and dissipated
some gloomy fancies about a night to
be passed in a forest.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="XANTEN" id="XANTEN">XANTEN.</a></h3>

<p>This is a small town, near the
Rhine, without much appearance of prosperity,
but neater than most of the others
around it. Several narrow streets open into
a wide and pleasant market-place, in the
centre of which an old but flourishing elm
has its branches carefully extended by a
circular railing, to form an arbour over
benches. A cathedral, that proves the town
to have been once more considerable, is on
the north side of this place; a fine building,
which, shewn by the moon of a summer
midnight, when only the bell of the adjoining
convent calling the monks to prayers,
and the waving of the aged tree, were
to be heard, presented a scene before the
windows of our inn, that fully recompensed
for its want of accommodation.</p>

<p>There were also humbler reasons towards
contentment; for the people of the house
were extremely desirous to afford it; and
the landlord was an orator in French, of
which and his address he was pleasantly
vain. He received us with an air of humour,
mingled with his complaisance, and
hoped, that, "as <i>Monsieur</i> was <i>Anglois</i>, he
should surprise him with his <i>vin extraordinaire</i>,
all the Rhenish wine being adulterated
by the Dutch, before they sent it to
England. His house could not be fine, because
he had little money; but he had an
excellent cook, otherwise it could not be
expected that the prebendaries of the cathedral
would dine at it, every day, and become,
as they were, <i>vraiment, Monsieur,
gros comme vous me voyez!</i>"</p>

<p>There are in this small town several monasteries
and one convent of noble canonesses,
of which last the members are few,
and the revenues very great. The interior
of the cathedral is nearly as grand as the
outside; and mass is performed in it with
more solemnity than in many, which have
larger institutions.</p>

<p>We left Xanten, the next morning, in
high spirits, expecting to reach Cologne,
which was little more than fifty miles distant,
before night, though the landlord and
the postmaster hinted, that we should go no
further than Neuss. This was our first use
of the German post, the slowness of which,
though it has been so often described, we
had not estimated. The day was intensely
hot, and the road, unsheltered by trees, lay
over deep sands, that reflected the rays.
The refreshing forests of yesterday we now
severely regretted, and watched impatiently
to catch a freer air from the summit of
every hill on the way. The postillion
would permit his horses to do little more
than walk, and every step threw up heaps
of dust into the chaise. It had been so often
said by travellers, that money has as little
effect in such cases as intreaties, or threats,
that we supposed this slowness irremediable,
which was really intended only to produce
an offer of what we would willingly have
given.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="RHEINBERG" id="RHEINBERG">RHEINBERG.</a></h3>

<p>In something more than three hours,
we reached Rheinberg, distant about nine
miles; a place often mentioned in the military
history of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and which we had supposed would
at least gratify us by the shew of magnificent
ruins, together with some remains of
its former importance. It is a wretched
place of one dirty street, and three or four
hundred mean houses, surrounded by a decayed
wall that never was grand, and half
filled by inhabitants, whose indolence, while
it is probably more to be pitied than blamed,
accounts for the sullenness and wretchedness
of their appearance. Not one symptom
of labour, or comfort, was to be perceived
in the whole town. The men seemed,
for the most part, to be standing at their
doors, in unbuckled shoes and woollen caps.
What few women we saw were brown,
without the appearance of health, which
their leanness and dirtiness prevented. Some
small shops of hucksters' wares were the
only signs of trade.</p>

<p>The inn, that seemed to be the best, was
such as might be expected in a remote village,
in a cross road in England. The landlord
was standing before the door in his
cap, and remained there some time after we
had found the way into a sitting room, and
from thence, for want of attendance, into
a kitchen; where two women, without
stockings, were watching over some sort of
cookery in earthen jugs. We were supplied,
at length, with bread, butter and sour wine,
and did not suffer ourselves to consider this
as any specimen of German towns, because
Rheinberg was not a station of the post;
a delusion, the spirit of which continued
through several weeks, for we were always
finding reasons to believe, that the wretchedness
of present places and persons was
produced by some circumstances, which
would not operate in other districts.</p>

<p>This is the condition of a town, which,
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
was thought important enough to be five
times attacked by large armies. <span class="smallcaps">Farnese</span>,
the Spanish commander, was diverted from
his attempt upon it, by the necessity of relieving
Zutphen, then besieged by the Earl
of Leicester: in 1589, the Marquis of Varambon
invested it, for the Spaniards, by
order of the Prince of Parma; but it was
relieved by our Colonel Vere, who, after a
long battle, completely defeated the Spanish
army. In 1599, when it was attacked by
Mendoza, a magazine caught fire. The
governor, his family, and a part of the garrison
were buried in the ruins of a tower,
and the explosion sunk several vessels in the
Rhine; after which, the remainder of the
garrison surrendered the place. The Prince
of Orange retook it in 1633. Four years
afterwards, the Spaniards attempted to surprise
it in the night; but the Deputy
Governor and others, who perceived that
the garrison could not be immediately collected,
passed the walls, and, pretending to
be deserters, mingled with the enemy, whom
they persuaded to delay the attack for a few
minutes. The troops within were in the
mean time prepared for their defence, and
succeeded in it; but the Governor, with
two officers and fifteen soldiers who had
accompanied him, being discovered, were
killed. All these contests were for a place
not belonging to either party, being in the
electorate of Cologne, but which was valuable
to both, for its neighbourhood to
their frontiers.</p>

<p>Beyond Rheinberg, our prospects were
extensive, but not so woody, or so rich as
those of the day before, and few villages
enlivened the landscape. Open corn lands,
intermixed with fields of turnips, spread to
a considerable distance, on both sides; on
the east, the high ridges of the Westphalian
mountains shut up the scene. The Rhine,
which frequently swept near the road,
shewed a broad surface, though shrunk
within its sandy shores by the dryness of
the season. Not a single vessel animated its
current, which was here tame and smooth,
though often interrupted by sands, that rose
above its level.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="HOOGSTRASS" id="HOOGSTRASS">HOOGSTRASS.</a></h3>

<p>The next town was Hoogstrass, a
post station, fifteen miles from Xanten, of
which we saw little more than the inn, the
other part of this small place being out of
the road. A large house, which might
have been easily made convenient, and was
really not without plenty, confirmed our
notion, that, at the post stages, there would
always be some accommodation. We dined
here, and were well attended. The landlord,
a young man who had served in the
army of the country, and appeared by his
dress to have gained some promotion, was
very industrious in the house, during this
interval of his other employments.</p>

<p>The next stage was of eighteen miles,
which make a German post and an half;
and, during this space, we passed by only
one town, Ordingen, or Urdingen, the
greatest part of which spread between the
road and the Rhine.</p>

<p>Towards evening, the country became
more woody, and the slender spires of convents
frequently appeared, sheltered in their
groves and surrounded by corn lands of
their own domain. One of these, nearer to
the road, was a noble mansion, and, with
its courts, offices and gardens, spread over
a considerable space. A summer-house, built
over the garden wall, had no windows towards
the road, but there were several small
apertures, which looked upon it and beyond
to a large tract of inclosed wood, the property
of the convent.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="NEUSS" id="NEUSS">NEUSS.</a></h3>

<p>Soon after sun-set, we came to Neuss,
which, as it is a post town, and was mentioned
as far off as Xanten, we had been
sure would afford a comfortable lodging,
whether there were any vestiges, or not, of
its ancient and modern history. The view
of it, at some little distance, did not altogether
contradict this notion, for it stands upon
a gentle ascent, and the spires of several
convents might justly give ideas of a considerable
town to those, who had not learned
how slightly such symptoms are to be attended
to in Germany.</p>

<p>On each side of the gate, cannon balls
of various sizes remain in the walls. Within,
you enter immediately into a close street
of high, but dirty stone houses, from which
you expect to escape presently, supposing it
to be only some wretched quarter, appropriated
to disease and misfortune. You see
no passengers, but, at the door of every
house, an haggard group of men and women
stare upon you with looks of hungry
rage, rather than curiosity, and their gaunt
figures excite, at first, more fear than pity.
Continuing to look for the better quarter,
and to pass between houses, that seem to
have been left after a siege and never entered
since, the other gate of the town at
length appears, which you would rather
pass at midnight than stop at any place yet
perceived. Within a small distance of the
gate, there is, however, a house with a wider
front, and windows of unshattered glass and
walls not quite as black as the others, which
is known to be the inn only because the
driver stops there, for, according to the
etiquette of sullenness in Germany, the people
of the house make no shew of receiving
you.</p>

<p>If it had not already appeared, that there
was no other inn, you might learn it from
the manners of the two hostesses and their
servants. Some sort of accommodation is,
however, to be had; and those, who have
been longer from the civilities and assiduities
of similar places in England, may, by more
submission and more patience, obtain it
sooner than we did. By these means they
may reduce all their difficulties into one,
that of determining whether the windows
shall be open or shut; whether they will
endure the closeness of the rooms, or will
admit air, loaded with the feculence of putrid
kennels, that stagnate along the whole
town.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Novesium</i> of Tacitus, the entrance
of the thirteenth legion into which
he relates, at a time when the Rhine, <i>incognita
illi c&oelig;lo siccitate</i>, became <i>vix navium
patiens</i>, and which <span class="smallcaps">Vocula</span> was soon after
compelled to surrender by the treachery of
other leaders and the corruption of his
army, whom he addressed, just before his
murder, in the fine speech, beginning,
"<i>Nunquam apud vos verba feci, aut pro
vobis solicitior, aut pro me securior</i>"; a passage
so near to the <i>cunctisque timentem, securumque
sui</i>, by which <span class="smallcaps">Lucan</span> describes <span class="smallcaps">Cato</span>,
that it must be supposed to have been inspired
by it.</p>

<p>This place stood a siege, for twelve
months, against 60,000 men, commanded
by <span class="smallcaps">Charles</span> the <span class="smallcaps">Bold</span>, Duke of Burgundy,
and succeeded in its resistance. But, in
1586, when it held out for <span class="smallcaps">Gebhert de
Trusches</span>, an Elector of Cologne, expelled
by his Chapter, for having married, it
was the scene of a dreadful calamity. <span class="smallcaps">Farnese</span>,
the Spanish General, who had just
taken Venlo, marched against it with an
army, enraged at having lost the plunder of
that place by a capitulation. When the inhabitants
of Neuss were upon the point of
surrendering it, upon similar terms, the
army, resolving not to lose another prey of
blood and gold, rushed to the assault, set
fire to the place, and murdered all the inhabitants,
except a few women and children,
who took refuge in two churches,
which alone were saved from the flames.</p>

<p>When the first shock of the surprise,
indignation and pity, excited by the mention
of such events, is overcome, we are,
of course, anxious to ascertain whether the
perpetrators of them were previously distinguished
by a voluntary entrance into situations,
that could be supposed to mark their
characters. This was the army of Philip
the Second. The soldiers were probably,
for the most part, forced into the service.
The officers, of whom only two are related
to have opposed the massacre, could not
have been so.</p>

<p>What was then the previous distinction of
the officers of Philip the Second? But
it is not proper to enter into a discussion
here of the nature of their employment.</p>

<p>Neuss was rebuilt, on the same spot; the
situation being convenient for an intercourse
with the eastern shore of the Rhine, especially
with Dusseldorff, to which it is nearly
opposite. The ancient walls were partly
restored by the French, in 1602. One of
the churches, spared by the Spaniards, was
founded by a daughter of <span class="smallcaps">Charlemagne</span>,
in the ninth century, and is now attached
to the Chapter of Noble Ladies of St. Quirin;
besides which there are a Chapter
of Canons, and five or six convents in the
place.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="COLOGNE" id="COLOGNE">COLOGNE.</a></h3>

<p>From Neuss hither we passed
through a deep, sandy road, that sometimes
wound near the Rhine, the shores of which
were yet low and the water tame and
shallow. There were no vessels upon it,
to give one ideas either of the commerce,
or the population of its banks.</p>

<p>The country, for the greater part of
twenty miles, was a flat of corn lands;
but, within a short distance of Cologne, a
gentle rise affords a view of the whole
city, whose numerous towers and steeples
had before appeared, and of the extensive
plains, that spread round it. In the
southern perspective of these, at the distance
of about eight leagues, rise the fantastic
forms of what are called the Seven
Mountains; westward, are the cultivated
hills, that extend towards Flanders; and,
eastward, over the Rhine, the distant mountains,
that run through several countries of
interior Germany. Over the wild and gigantic
features of the Seven Mountains dark
thunder mists soon spread an awful obscurity,
and heightened the expectation, which
this glimpse of them had awakened, concerning
the scenery we were approaching.</p>

<p>The appearance of Cologne, at the distance
of one, or two miles, is not inferior to
the conception, which a traveller may have
already formed of one of the capitals of
Germany, should his mind have obeyed that
almost universal illusion of fancy, which
dresses up the images of places unseen, as
soon as much expectation, or attention is
directed towards them. The air above is
crowded with the towers and spires of
churches and convents, among which the
cathedral, with its huge, unfinished mass,
has a striking appearance. The walls are
also high enough to be observed, and their
whole inclosure seems, at a distance, to be
thickly filled with buildings.</p>

<p>We should have known ourselves to be
in the neighbourhood of some place larger
than usual, from the sight of two, or three
carriages, at once, on the road; nearly the
first we had seen in Germany. There is
besides some shew of labour in the adjoining
villages; but the sallow countenances
and miserable air of the people prove, that
it is not a labour beneficial to them. The
houses are only the desolated homes of these
villagers; for there is not one that can be
supposed to belong to any prosperous inhabitant
of the city, or to afford the coveted
stillness, in which the active find an occasional
reward, and the idle a perpetual
misery.</p>

<p>A bridge over a dry foss&eacute; leads to the
northern gate, on each side of which a small
modern battery defends the ancient walls.
The city is not fortified, according to any
present sense of the term, but is surrounded
by these walls and by a ditch, of which the
latter, near the northern gate, serves as a
sort of kitchen garden to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Before passing the inner gate, a soldier
demanded our names, and we shewed our
passport, for the first time; but, as the inquisitor
did not understand French, in
which language passports from England are
written, it was handed to his comrades, who
formed a circle about our chaise, and began,
with leaden looks, to spell over the paper.
Some talked, in the mean time, of examining
the baggage; and the money, which
we gave to prevent this, being in various
pieces and in Prussian coin, which is not
perfectly understood here, the whole party
turned from the passport, counting and estimating
the money in the hand of their collector,
as openly as if it had been a legal
tribute. When this was done and they
had heard, with surprise, that we had not
determined where to lodge, being inclined
to take the pleasantest inn, we wrote our
names in the corporal's dirty book, and
were allowed to drive, under a dark tower,
into the city.</p>

<p>Instantly, the narrow street, gloomy
houses, stagnant kennels and wretchedly
looking people reminded us of the horrors
of Neuss. The lower windows of these prison-like
houses are so strongly barricadoed,
that we had supposed the first two, or three,
to be really parts of a gaol; but it soon appeared,
that this profusion of heavy iron
work was intended to exclude, not to confine,
robbers. A succession of narrow streets,
in which the largest houses were not less
disgusting than the others for the filthiness
of their windows, doorways and massy walls,
continued through half the city. In one of
these streets, or lanes, the postillion stopped
at the door of an inn, which he said was
the best; but the suffocating air of the street
rendered it unnecessary to enquire, whether,
contrary to appearances, there could be any
accommodation within, and, as we had read
of many squares, or market-places, he was
desired to stop at an inn, situated in one of
these. Thus we came to the Hotel de
Prague, a large straggling building, said to
be not worse than the others, for wanting
half its furniture, and probably superior to
them, by having a landlord of better than
German civility.</p>

<p>Having counted from our windows the
spires of ten, or twelve churches, or convents,
we were at leisure to walk farther
into the city, and to look for the spacious
squares, neat streets, noble public buildings
and handsome houses, which there could be
no doubt must be found in an Imperial and
Electoral city, seated on the Rhine, at a
point where the chief roads from Holland
and Flanders join those of Germany, treated
by all writers as a considerable place, and
evidently by its situation capable of becoming
a sort of <i>emporium</i> for the three
countries. The spot, into which our inn
opened, though a parallelogram of considerable
extent, bordered by lime trees, we
passed quickly through, perceiving, that the
houses on all its sides were mean buildings,
and therefore such as could not deserve the
attention in the Imperial and Electoral city
of Cologne. There are streets from each
angle of this place, and we pursued them all
in their turn, narrow, winding and dirty as
they are, pestilent with kennels, gloomy
from the height and blackness of the houses,
unadorned by any public buildings, except
the churches, that were grand, or by one
private dwelling, that appeared to be clean,
with little shew of traffic and less of passengers,
either busy, or gay, till we saw them
ending in other streets still worse, or concluded
by the gates of the city. One of them,
indeed, led through a market-place, in
which the air is free from the feculence of
the streets, but which is inferior to the
other opening in space, and not better surrounded
by buildings.</p>

<p>"These diminutive observations seem to
take away something from the dignity of
writing, and therefore are never communicated,
but with hesitation, and a little fear
of abasement and contempt."<a href="#fn2"><span class="small"><sup>2</sup></span></a><a name="fn2r" id="fn2r"></a> And it is
not only because they take away something
from the dignity of writing, that such observations
are withheld. To be thought
capable of commanding more pleasures and
preventing more inconveniences than others
is a too general passport to respect; and,
in the ordinary affairs of life, for one, that
will shew somewhat less prosperity than he
has, in order to try who will really respect
him, thousands exert themselves to assume
an appearance of more, which they might
know can procure only the mockery of
esteem for themselves, and the reality of it
for their supposed conditions. Authors are
not always free from a willingness to receive
the fallacious sort of respect, that attaches to
accidental circumstances, for the real sort,
of which it would be more reasonable to be
proud. A man, relating part of the history
of his life, which is always necessarily done
by a writer of travels, does not choose to
shew that his course could lie through any
scenes deficient of delights; or that, if it
did, he was not enough elevated by his
friends, importance, fortune, fame, or business,
to be incapable of observing them minutely.
The curiosities of cabinets and of
courts are, therefore, exactly described, and
as much of every occurrence as does not
shew the relater moving in any of the
plainer walks of life; but the difference between
the stock of physical comforts in
different countries, the character of conditions,
if the phrase may be used, such as it
appears in the ordinary circumstances of residence,
dress, food, cleanliness, opportunities
of relaxation; in short, the information,
which all may gain, is sometimes left
to be gained by all, not from the book, but
from travel. A writer, issuing into the
world, makes up what he mistakes for his
best appearance, and is continually telling
his happiness, or shewing his good-humour,
as people in a promenade always smile,
and always look round to observe whether
they are seen smiling. The politest salutation
of the Chinese, when they meet, is,
"Sir, prosperity is painted on your countenance;"
or, "your whole air announces
your felicity;" and the writers of travels,
especially since the censure thrown upon
<span class="smallcaps">Smollet</span>, seem to provide, that their prosperity
shall be painted on their volumes,
and all their observations announce their
felicity.</p>

<p><a href="#fn2r">2</a><a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a> Dr. Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p>Cologne, though it bears the name of the
Electorate, by which it is surrounded, is an
imperial city; and the Elector, as to temporal
affairs, has very little jurisdiction
within it. The government has an affectation
of being formed upon the model of
Republican Rome; a form certainly not
worthy of imitation, but which is as much
disgraced by this burlesque of it, as ancient
statues are by the gilding and the wigs,
with which they are said to be sometimes
arrayed by modern hands. There is a senate
of forty-nine persons, who, being returned
at different times of the year, are
partly nominated by the remaining members,
and partly chosen by twenty-two tribes
of burgesses, or rather by so many companies
of traders. Of six burgomasters,
two are in office every third year, and,
when these appear in public, they are preceded
by <span class="smallcaps">Lictors</span>, bearing <i>fasces</i>, sur-mounted
by their <i>own arms</i>! Each of the
tribes, or companies, has a President, and
the twenty-two Presidents form a Council,
which is authorised to enquire into the conduct
of the Senate: but the humbleness of
the burgesses in their individual condition
has virtually abolished all this scheme of a
political constitution. Without some of the
intelligence and personal independence,
which are but little consistent with the general
poverty and indolence of German
traders, nothing but the forms of any constitution
can be preserved, long after the
virtual destruction of it has been meditated
by those in a better condition. The greater
part of these companies of traders having,
in fact, no trade which can place them
much above the rank of menial servants
to their rich customers, the design, that
their Council shall check the Senate, and
the Senate direct the Burgomasters, has
now, of course, little effect. And this, or
a still humbler condition, is that of several
cities in Germany, called free and independent,
in which the neighbouring sovereigns
have scarcely less authority, though with
something more of circumstance, than in
their own dominions.</p>

<p>The constitution of Cologne permits, indeed,
some direct interference of the
Elector; for the Tribunal of Appeal, which is
the supreme court of law, is nominated by
him: he has otherwise no direct power
within the city; and, being forbidden to
reside there more than three days successively,
he does not even retain a palace,
but is contented with a suite of apartments,
reserved for his use at an inn. That this
exclusion is no punishment, those, who
have ever passed two days at Cologne, will
admit; and it can tend very little to lessen
his influence, for the greatest part of his
personal expenditure must reach the merchants
of the place; and the officers of several
of his territorial jurisdictions make
part of the inhabitants. His residences,
with which he is remarkably well provided,
are at Bonn; at Bruhl, a palace between
Cologne and that place; at Poppelsdorff,
which is beyond it; at Herzogs Freud, an
hunting seat; and in Munster, of which he
is the Bishop.</p>

<p>The duties of customs and excise are
imposed by the magistrates of the city, and
these enable them to pay their contributions
to the Germanic fund; for, though such
cities are formally independent of the neighbouring
princes and nobility, they are not
so of the general laws or expences of the
empire, in the Diet of which they have
some small share, forty-nine cities being allowed
to send two representatives, and thus
to have two votes out of an hundred and
thirty-six. These duties, of both sorts, are
very high at Cologne; and the first form a
considerable part of the interruptions, which
all the States upon the Rhine give to the
commerce of that river. Here also commodities,
intended to be carried beyond the
city by water, must be re-shipped; for, in
order to provide cargoes for the boatmen of
the place, vessels from the lower parts of
the Rhine are not allowed to ascend beyond
Cologne, and those from the higher parts
cannot descend it farther. They may, indeed,
reload with other cargoes for their
return; and, as they constantly do so, the
Cologne boatmen are not much benefited by
the regulation; but the transfer of the
goods employs some hands, subjects them
better to the inspection of the customhouse
officers, and makes it necessary for the merchants
of places, on both sides, trading with
each other, to have intermediate correspondents
here. Yet, notwithstanding all this
aggression upon the freedom of trade, Cologne
is less considerable as a port, than
some Dutch towns, never mentioned in a
book, and is inferior, perhaps, to half the
minor seaports in England. We could not
find more than thirty vessels of burthen
against the quay, all mean and ill-built, except
the Dutch, which are very large, and,
being constructed purposely for a tedious navigation,
contain apartments upon the deck
for the family of the skipper, well furnished,
and so commodious as to have four or five
sashed windows on each side, generally gay
with flower-pots. Little flower-gardens, too,
sometimes formed upon the roof of the
cabin, increase the domestic comforts of the
skipper; and the neatness of his vessel can,
perhaps, be equalled only by that of a
Dutch house. In a time of perfect peace,
there is no doubt more traffic; but, from
what we saw of the general means and occasions
of commerce in Germany, we cannot
suppose it to be much reduced by war.
Wealthy and commercial countries may be
injured immensely by making war either
for Germany or against it; by too much
friendship or too much enmity; but Germany
itself cannot be proportionately injured
with them, except when it is the
scene of actual violence. Englishmen, who
feel, as they always must, the love of their
own country much increased by the view
of others, should be induced, at every step,
to wish, that there may be as little political
intercourse as possible, either of friendship
or enmity, between the blessings of their
Island and the wretchedness of the Continent.</p>

<p>Our inn had formerly been a convent,
and was in a part of the town where such
societies are more numerous than elsewhere.
At five o'clock, on the Sunday after
our arrival, the bells of churches and
convents began to sound on all sides, and
there was scarcely any entire intermission
of them till evening. The places of public
amusement, chiefly a sort of tea-gardens,
were then set open, and, in many streets,
the sound of music and dancing was heard
almost as plainly as that of the bells had
been before; a disgusting excess of licentiousness,
which appeared in other instances,
for we heard, at the same time, the voices
of a choir on one side of the street, and the
noise of a billiard table on the other. Near
the inn, this contrast was more observable.
While the strains of revelry arose from an
adjoining garden, into which our windows
opened, a pause in the music allowed us to
catch some notes of the vesper service, performing
in a convent of the order of Clarisse,
only three or four doors beyond. Of
the severe rules of this society we had been
told in the morning. The members take a
vow, not only to renounce the world, but
their dearest friends, and are never after
permitted to see even their fathers or mothers,
though they may sometimes converse
with the latter from behind a curtain. And,
lest some lingering remains of filial affection
should tempt an unhappy nun to lift the
veil of separation between herself and her
mother, she is not allowed to speak even
with her, but in the presence of the abbess.
Accounts of such horrible perversions of
human reason make the blood thrill and the
teeth chatter. Their fathers they can never
speak to, for no man is suffered to be in
any part of the convent used by the sisterhood,
nor, indeed, is admitted beyond the
gate, except when there is a necessity for
repairs, when all the votaries of the order
are previously secluded. It is not easily,
that a cautious mind becomes convinced of
the existence of such severe orders; when
it does, astonishment at the artificial miseries,
which the ingenuity of human beings
forms for themselves by seclusion, is as
boundless as at the other miseries, with
which the most trivial vanity and envy so
frequently pollute the intercourses of social
life. The poor nuns, thus nearly entombed
during their lives, are, after death, tied upon
a board, in the clothes they die in, and,
with only their veils thrown over the face,
are buried in the garden of the convent.</p>

<p>During this day, Trinity Sunday, processions
were passing on all sides, most of
them attended by some sort of martial
music. Many of the parishes, of which
there are nineteen, paraded with their officers;
and the burgesses, who are distributed
into eight corps, under a supposition that
they could and would defend the city, if it
was attacked, presented their captains at the
churches. The host accompanied all these
processions. A party of the city guards followed,
and forty or fifty persons out of
uniform, the representatives probably of the
burgesses, who are about six thousand, succeeded.
Besides the guards, there was only
one man in uniform, who, in the burlesque
dress of a drum-major, entertained the populace
by a kind of extravagant marching
dance, in the middle of the procession. Our
companion would not tell us that this was
the captain.</p>

<p>The cathedral, though unfinished, is
conspicuous, amongst a great number of
churches, for the dignity of some detached
features, that shew part of the vast design
formed for the whole. It was begun, in
1248, by the Elector Conrad, who is related,
in an hexameter inscription over a
gate, to have laid the first stone himself.
In 1320, the choir was finished, and the
workmen continued to be employed upon
the other parts in 1499, when of two
towers, destined to be 580 feet above the
roof, one had risen 21 feet, and the other
150 feet, according to the measurement
mentioned in a printed description. We
did not learn at what period the design of
completing the edifice was abandoned; but
the original founder lived to see all the
treasures expended, which he had collected
for the purpose. In its present state, the
inequality of its vast towers renders it a
striking object at a considerable distance;
and, from the large unfilled area around it,
the magnificence of its Gothic architecture,
especially of some parts, which have not
been joined to the rest, and appear to be the
ruined remains, rather than the commencement
of a work, is viewed with awful delight.</p>

<p>In the interior of the cathedral, a fine
choir leads to an altar of black marble,
raised above several steps, which, being free
from the incongruous ornaments usual in
Romish churches, is left to impress the
mind by its majestic plainness. The tall
painted windows above, of which there are
six, are superior in richness of colouring and
design to any we ever saw; beyond even
those in the Chapter-house at York, and
most resembling the very fine ones in the
cathedral of Canterbury. The nave is deformed
by a low wooden roof, which appears
to have been intended only as a temporary
covering, and should certainly be
succeeded by one of equal dignity to the
vast columns placed for its support, whether
the other parts of the original design
can ever be completed or not.</p>

<p>By some accident we did not see the
tomb of the three kings of Jerusalem, whose
bodies are affirmed to have been brought
here from Milan in 1162, when the latter
city was destroyed by the Emperor Frederic
Barbarossa. Their boasted treasures of golden
crowns and diamonds pass, of course, without
our estimation.</p>

<p>A description of the churches in Cologne,
set out with good antiquarian minuteness,
would fill volumes. The whole number of
churches, chapters and chapels, which last
are by far the most numerous, is not less
than eighty, and none are without an history
of two or three centuries. They are
all opened on Sundays; and we can believe,
that the city may contain, as is asserted,
40,000 souls, for nearly all that we
saw were well attended. In one, indeed,
the congregation consisted only of two or
three females, kneeling at a great distance
from the altar, with an appearance of the
utmost intentness upon the service, and abstraction
from the noise of the processions,
that could be easily heard within. They
were entirely covered with a loose black
drapery; whether for penance, or not, we
did not hear. In the cathedral, a figure in
the same attitude was rendered more interesting
by her situation beneath the broken
arches and shattered fret-work of a painted
window, through which the rays of the sun
scarcely penetrated to break the shade she
had chosen.</p>

<p>Several of the chapels are not much
larger than an ordinary apartment, but they
are higher, that the nuns of some adjoining
convent may have a gallery, where,
veiled from observation by a lawn curtain,
their voices often mingle sweetly with
the choir. There are thirty-nine convents
of women and nineteen of men, which are
supposed to contain about fifteen hundred
persons. The chapters, of which some are
noble and extremely opulent, support nearly
four hundred more; and there are said
to be, upon the whole, between two and
three thousand persons, under religious denominations,
in Cologne. Walls of convents
and their gardens appear in every
street, but do not attract notice, unless, as
frequently happens, their bell sounds while
you are passing. Some of their female inhabitants
may be seen in various parts of
the city, for there is an order, the members
of which are employed, by rotation, in
teaching children and attending the sick.
Those of the noble chapters are little more
confined than if they were with their own
families, being permitted to visit their
friends, to appear at balls and promenades,
to wear what dresses they please, except
when they chaunt in the choir, and to
quit the chapter, if the offer of an acceptable
marriage induces their families to authorise
it; but their own admission into the
chapter proves them to be noble by sixteen
quarterings, or four generations, and the
offer must be from a person of equal rank,
or their descendants could not be received
into similar chapters; an important circumstance
in the affairs of the German noblesse.</p>

<p>Some of these ladies we saw in the church
of their convent. Their habits were remarkably
graceful; robes of lawn and black
silk flowed from the shoulder, whence a
quilled ruff, somewhat resembling that of
Queen Elizabeth's time, spread round the
neck. The hair was in curls, without powder,
and in the English fashion. Their
voices were peculiarly sweet, and they sung
the responses with a kind of plaintive tenderness,
that was extremely interesting.</p>

<p>The Jesuits' church is one of the grandest
in Cologne, and has the greatest display
of paintings over its numerous altars, as
well as of marble pillars. The churches of
the chapters are, for the most part, very
large, and endowed with the richest ornaments,
which are, however, not shewn to
the public, except upon days of f&ecirc;te. We
do not remember to have seen that of the
chapter of St. Ursula, where heads and other
relics are said to be handed to you from
shelves, like books in a library; nor that of
the convent of Jacobins, where some MSS.
and other effects of Albert the Great, bishop
of Ratisbon, are among the treasures of
the monks.</p>

<p>Opposite to the Jesuits' church was an
hospital for wounded soldiers, several of
whom were walking in the court yard
before it, half-clothed in dirty woollen,
through which the bare arms of many appeared.
Sickness and neglect had subdued
all the symptoms of a soldier; and it was
impossible to distinguish the wounded French
from the others, though we were assured
that several of that nation were in the
crowd. The windows of the hospital were
filled with figures still more wretched.
There was a large assemblage of spectators,
who looked as if they were astonished to
see, that war is compounded of something
else, besides the glories, of which it is so
easy to be informed.</p>

<p>The soldiery of Cologne are under the
command of the magistrates, and are employed
only within the gates of the city.
The whole body does not exceed an hundred
and fifty, whom we saw reviewed by
their colonel, in the place before the Hotel
de Prague. The uniform is red, faced with
white. The men wear whiskers, and affect
an air of ferocity, but appear to be mostly
invalids, who have grown old in their
guard-houses.</p>

<p>Protestants, though protected in their
persons, are not allowed the exercise of
their religion within the walls of the city,
but have a chapel in a village on the other
side of the Rhine. As some of the chief
merchants, and those who are most useful
to the inhabitants, are of the reformed
church, they ventured lately to request that
they might have a place of worship within
the city; but they received the common answer,
which opposes all sort of improvement,
religious or civil, that, though the
privilege in itself might be justly required,
it could not be granted, because they would
then think of asking something more.</p>

<p>The government of Cologne in ecclesiastical
affairs is with the Elector, as archbishop,
and the Chapter as his council. In
civil matters, though the city constitution is
of little effect, the real power is not so constantly
with him as might be supposed;
those, who have influence, being sometimes
out of his interest. Conversation, as we
were told, was scarcely less free than in
Holland, where there is justly no opposition
to any opinion, however improper, or absurd,
except from the reason of those, who
hear it. On that account, and because of its
easy intercourse with Brussels and Spa, this
city is somewhat the resort of strangers, by
whom such conversation is, perhaps, chiefly
carried on; but those must come from very
wretched countries who can find pleasure in
a residence at Cologne.</p>

<p>Amongst the public buildings must be
reckoned the Theatre, of which we did not
see the inside, there being no performance,
during our stay, except on Sunday. This,
it seems, may be opened, without offence
to the Magistrates, though a protestant
church may not. It stands in a row of
small houses, from which it is distinguished
only by a painted front, once tawdry and
now dirty, with the inscription, "<i>Musis
Gratiisque decentibus</i>." The Town-house is
an awkward and irregular stone building.
The arsenal, which is in one of the narrowest
streets, we should have passed, without
notice, if it had not been pointed out to
us. As a building, it is nothing more than
such as might be formed out of four or
five of the plainest houses laid into one.
Its contents are said to be chiefly antient
arms, of various fashions and sizes, not very
proper for modern use.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="BONN" id="BONN">BONN.</a></h3>

<p>After a stay of nearly three tedious
days, we left Cologne for Bonn, passing
through an avenue of limes, which extends
from one place to the other, without
interruption, except where there is a small
half way village. The distance is not less
than eighteen miles, and the diversified culture
of the plains, through which it passes,
is unusually grateful to the eye, after the
dirty buildings of Cologne and the long
uniformity of corn lands in the approach to
it. Vines cover a great part of these plains,
and are here first seen in Germany, except,
indeed, within the walls of Cologne itself,
which contain many large inclosures, converted
from gardens and orchards into well
sheltered vineyards. The vines reminded
us of English hop plants, being set, like
them, in rows, and led round poles to various
heights, though all less than that of
hops. Corn, fruit or herbs were frequently
growing between the rows, whose light
green foliage mingled beautifully with yellow
wheat and larger patches of garden
plantations, that spread, without any inclosures,
to the sweeping Rhine, on the left.
Beyond, appeared the blue ridges of Westphalian
mountains. On the right, the plains
extend to a chain of lower and less distant
hills, whose skirts are covered with vines
and summits darkened with thick woods.</p>

<p>The Elector's palace of Bruhl is on the
right hand of the road, at no great distance,
but we were not told, till afterwards, of
the magnificent architecture and furniture,
which ought to have attracted our curiosity.</p>

<p>On a green and circular hill, near the
Rhine, stands the Benedictine abbey of
Siegbourg, one of the first picturesque objects
of the rich approach to Bonn; and,
further on, the castle-like towers of a convent
of noble ladies; both societies celebrated
for their wealth and the pleasantness
of their situations, which command extensive
prospects over the country, on each
side of the river. As we drew near Bonn,
we frequently caught, between the trees of
the avenue, imperfect, but awakening glimpses
of the pointed mountains beyond; contrasted
with the solemn grandeur of which
was the beauty of a round woody hill, apparently
separated from them only by the
Rhine and crowned with the spire of a
comely convent. Bonn, with tall slender
steeples and the trees of its ramparts, thus
backed by sublime mountains, looks well,
as you approach it from Cologne, though
neither its noble palace, nor the Rhine,
which washes its walls, are seen from hence.
We were asked our names at the gate, but
had no trouble about passports, or baggage.
A long and narrow street leads from thence
to the market-place, not disgusting you either
with the gloom, or the dirt of Cologne,
though mean houses are abundantly intermixed
with the others, and the best are
far from admirable. The <i>physiognomy of
the place</i>, if one may use the expression, is
wholesome, though humble. By the recommendation
of a Dutch merchant, we
went to an inn in another street, branching
from the market-place; and found it the
cleanest, since we had left Holland.</p>

<p>Bonn may be called the political capital
of the country, the Elector's Court being
held only there; and, what would not be
expected, this has importance enough to
command the residence of an agent from
almost every Power in Europe. The present
Elector being the uncle of the Emperor,
this attention is, perhaps, partly paid, with
the view, that it may be felt at the Court
of Vienna. Even Russia is not unrepresented
in this miniature State.</p>

<p>The Elector's palace is, in point of grandeur,
much better fitted to be the scene of
diplomatic ceremonies, than those of many
greater Sovereigns; and it is fitted also for
better than diplomatic purposes, being placed
before some of the most striking of nature's
features, of which it is nearly as worthy
an ornament as art can make. It is seated
on the western bank of the Rhine, the general
course of which it fronts, though it
forms a considerable angle with the part immediately
nearest. The first emotion, on
perceiving it, being that of admiration, at
its vastness, the wonder is, of course, equal,
with which you discover, that it is only
part of a greater design. It consists of a
centre and an eastern wing, which are completed,
and of a western wing, of which
not half is yet raised. The extent from
east to west is so great, that, if we had enquired
the measurement, we should have
been but little assisted in giving an idea of
the spectacle, exhibited by so immense a
building.</p>

<p>It is of stone, of an architecture, perhaps,
not adequate to the grandeur of its extent,
but which fills no part with unsuitable, or
inelegant ornaments. Along the whole garden
front, which is the chief, a broad terrace
supports a promenade and an orangery
of noble trees, occasionally refreshed by
fountains, that, ornamented with statues, rise
from marble basons. An arcade through
the centre of the palace leads to this terrace,
from whence the prospect is strikingly
beautiful and sublime. The eye passes over
the green lawn of the garden and a tract of
level country to the groupe, called the Seven
Mountains, broken, rocky and abrupt
towards their summits, yet sweeping finely
near their bases, and uniting with the plains
by long and gradual descents, that spread
round many miles. The nearest is about a
league and a half off. We saw them under
the cloudless sky of June, invested with
the mistiness of heat, which softening their
rocky points, and half veiling their recesses,
left much for the imagination to supply,
and gave them an a&euml;rial appearance, a faint
tint of silvery grey, that was inexpressibly
interesting. The Rhine, that winds at their
feet, was concealed from us by the garden
groves, but from the upper windows of
the palace it is seen in all its majesty.</p>

<p>On the right from this terrace, the smaller
palace of Poppelsdorff terminates a long
avenue of limes and chesnut trees, that
communicates with both buildings, and
above are the hill and the convent <i>Sanct&aelig;
Crucis</i>, the latter looking out from among
firs and shrubby steeps. From thence the
western horizon is bounded by a range of
hills, clothed to their summits with wood.
The plain, that extends between these and
the Rhine, is cultivated with vines and
corn, and the middle distance is marked by
a pyramidal mountain, darkened by wood
and crowned with the tower and walls of a
ruined castle.</p>

<p>The gardens of the palace are formally
laid out in straight walks and alleys of cut
trees; but the spacious lawn between these
gives fine effect to the perspective of the
distant mountains; and the bowery walks,
while they afford refreshing shelter from a
summer sun, allow partial views of the palace
and the romantic landscape.</p>

<p>It was the Elector Joseph Clement, the
same who repaired the city, left in a ruinous
state by the siege of 1703, under the
Duke of Marlborough, that built this
magnificent residence. There are in it many
suites of state rooms and every sort of apartment
usual in the mansions of Sovereigns;
saloons of audience and ceremony, a library,
a cabinet of natural history and a theatre.
Though these are readily opened to strangers,
we are to confess, that we did not see them,
being prevented by the attentions of those,
whose civilities gave them a right to command
us, while their situations enabled
them to point out the best occupation of
our time. The hall of the Grand Master of
the Teutonic Order, ornamented with portraits
of all the grand masters, we are, however,
sorry to have neglected even for the
delights of Poppelsdorff, which we were
presently shewn.</p>

<p>Leaving the palace, we passed through
the garden, on the right, to a fine avenue
of turf, nearly a mile long, bordered by
alleys of tall trees, and so wide, that the
late Elector had designed to form a canal
in the middle of it, for an opportunity of
passing between his palaces, by land, or
water, as he might wish. The palace of
Poppelsdorff terminates the perspective of
this avenue. It is a small building, surrounded
by its gardens, in a taste not very
good, and remarkable chiefly for the pleasantness
of its situation. An arcade, encompassing
a court in the interior, communicates
with all the apartments on the
ground floor, which is the principal, and
with the gardens, on the eastern side of the
chateau. The entrance is through a small
hall, decorated with the ensigns of hunting,
and round nearly the whole arcade
stags' heads are placed, at equal distances.
These have remained here, since the reign
of Clement Augustus, the founder of the
palace, who died in 1761; and they exhibit
some part of the history of his life; for,
under each, is an inscription, relating the
events and date of the hunt, by which he
killed it. There are twenty-three such ornaments.</p>

<p>The greatest part of the furniture had
been removed, during the approach of the
French, in 1792; and the Archduchess
Maria Christina, to whom the Elector, her
brother, had lent the chateau, was now
very far from sumptuously accommodated.
On this account, she passed much of her
time, at Goodesberg, a small watering place
in the neighbourhood. After her retreat
from Brussels, in consequence of the advances
of the French in the same year, she
had accompanied her husband, the Duke of
Saxe Teschen, into Saxony; but, since his
appointment to the command of the Emperor's
army of the Upper Rhine, her residence
had been established in the dominions
of her brother.</p>

<p>We were shewn through her apartments,
which she had left for Goodesberg, a few
hours before. On the table of her sitting
room lay the fragments of a painted cross,
composed of small pieces, like our dissected
maps, the putting of which together exercises
ingenuity and passes, perhaps, for a
sort of piety. The attendant said, that it
served to pass the time; but it cannot be
supposed, that rank and fortune have so
little power to bestow happiness, as that
their possessors should have recourse to such
means of lightening the hours of life.</p>

<p>On another table, was spread a map of
all the countries, then included in the
Theatre of War, and on it a box, filled
with small pieces of various coloured wax,
intended to mark the positions of the different
armies. These were of many shades;
for the Archduchess, who is said to be conversant
with military affairs and to have
descended to the firing of bombs at the siege
of Lisle, was able to distinguish the several
corps of the allied armies, that were acting
separately from each other. The positions
were marked up to the latest accounts then
public. The course of her thoughts was
visible from this chart, and they were interesting
to curiosity, being those of the
sister of the late unfortunate Queen of
France.</p>

<p>The walls of an adjoining cabinet were
ornamented with drawings from the antique
by the Archduchess, disposed upon a light
ground and serving instead of tapestry.</p>

<p>The chapel is a rotunda, rising into a
dome, and, though small, is splendid with
painting and gilding. In the centre are
four altars, formed on the four sides of a
square pedestal, that supports a figure of
our Saviour; but the beauty of this design
is marred by the vanity of placing near
each altar the statue of a founder of the
Teutonic order. The furniture of the
Elector's gallery is of crimson velvet and
gold.</p>

<p>On another side of the chateau, we were
shewn an apartment entirely covered with
grotto work, and called the hall of shells;
a curious instance of patient industry, having
been completed by one man, during a labour
of many years. Its situation in the
middle of an inhabited mansion is unsuitable
to the character of a grotto: but its
coolness must render it a very convenient
retreat; and the likenesses of animals, as
well as the other forms, into which the
shells are thrown, though not very elegant,
are fanciful enough, especially as the ornaments
of fountains, which play into several
parts of the room.</p>

<p>Leaving the palace by the bridge of a
moat, that nearly surrounds it, we passed
through the pleasant village of Poppelsdorff,
and ascended the hill <span class="smallcaps">Sanct&aelig; Crucis</span>,
called so from the convent of the same
name, which occupies its summit. The
road wound between thick woods; but we
soon left it for a path, that led more
immediately to the summit, among shrubs and
plantations of larch and fir, and which
opened into easy avenues of turf, that sometimes
allowed momentary views of other
woody points and of the plains around.
The turf was uncommonly fragrant and
fine, abounding with plants, which made
us regret the want of a Botanist's knowledge
and pleasures. During the ascent, the
peaked tops of the mountains of the Rhine,
so often admired below, began to appear
above a ridge of dark woods, very near us,
in a contrast of hues, which was exquisitely
fine. It was now near evening; the mistiness
of heat was gone from the surface of
these mountains, and they had assumed a
blue tint so peculiar and clear, that they
appeared upon the sky, like supernatural
transparencies.</p>

<p>We had heard, at Bonn, of the Capuchins'
courtesy, and had no hesitation to
knock at their gate, after taking some rest
in the portico of the church, from whence
we looked down another side of the mountain,
over the long plains between Bonn
and Cologne. Having waited some time at
the gate, during which many steps fled
along the passage and the head of a monk
appeared peeping through a window above,
a servant admitted us into a parlour, adjoining
the refectory, which appeared to
have been just left. This was the first convent
we had entered, and we could not
help expecting to see more than others had
described; an involuntary habit, from which
few are free, and which need not be imputed
to vanity, so long as the love of surprise
shall be so visible in human pursuits.
When the lay-brother had quitted us, to
inform the superior of our request, not a
footstep, or a voice approached, for near a
quarter of an hour, and the place seemed
as if uninhabited. Our curiosity had no
indulgence within the room, which was of
the utmost plainness, and that plainness free
from any thing, that the most tractable imagination
could suppose peculiar to a convent.
At length, a monk appeared, who
received us with infinite good humour, and
with the ease which must have been acquired
in more general society. His shaven
head and black garments formed a whimsical
contrast to the character of his person
and countenance, which bore no symptoms
of sorrow, or penance, and were, indeed,
animated by an air of cheerfulness and intelligence,
that would have become the happiest
inhabitant of the gayest city.</p>

<p>Through some silent passages, in which
he did not shew us a cell and we did not
perceive another monk, we passed to the
church, where the favour of several Electors
has assisted the display of paintings, marble,
sculpture, gold and silver, mingled and
arranged with magnificent effect. Among
these was the marble statue, brought from
England, at a great expence, and here called
a representation of St. Anne, who is said to
have found the Cross. Our conductor
seemed to be a man of good understanding
and desirous of being thought so; a disposition,
which gave an awkwardness to his
manner, when, in noticing a relic, he was
obliged to touch upon some unproved and
unimportant tradition, peculiar to his church
and not essential to the least article of our
faith. His sense of decorum as a member
of the convent seemed then to be struggling
with his vanity, as a man.</p>

<p>But there are relics here, pretending to
a connection with some parts of christian
history, which it is shocking to see introduced
to consideration by any means so
trivial and so liable to ridicule. It is, indeed,
wonderful, that the absurd exhibitions,
made in Romish churches, should so often
be minutely described, and dwelt upon in
terms of ludicrous exultation by those, who
do not intend that most malignant of offences
against human nature, the endeavour
to excite a wretched vanity by sarcasm and
jest, and to employ it in eradicating the
comforts of religion. To such writers, the
probable mischief of uniting with the mention
of the most important divine doctrines
the most ridiculous of human impositions
ought to be apparent; and, as the risk is
unnecessary in a Protestant country, why
is it encountered? That persons otherwise
inclined should adopt these topics is not surprising;
the easiest pretences to wit are
found to be made by means of familiar allusions
to sacred subjects, because their necessary
incongruity accomplishes the greatest
part of what, in other cases, must be done
by wit itself; there will, therefore, never be
an end of such allusions, till it is generally
seen, that they are the resources and symptoms
of mean understandings, urged by the
feverish desire of an eminence, to which
they feel themselves inadequate.</p>

<p>From the chapel we ascended to a tower
of the convent, whence all the scattered
scenes, of whose beauty, or sublimity, we
had caught partial glimpses between the
woods below, were collected into one vast
landscape, and exhibited almost to a single
glance. The point, on which the convent
stands, commands the whole horizon. To
the north, spread the wide plains, before
seen, covered with corn, then just embrowned,
and with vines and gardens,
whose alternate colours formed a gay checker
work with villages, convents and castles.
The grandeur of this level was unbroken
by any inclosures, that could seem to diminish
its vastness. The range of woody
heights, that bound it on the west, extend
to the southward, many leagues beyond the
hill <i>Sanct&aelig; Crucis</i>; but the uniform and
unbroken ridges of distant mountains, on
the east, cease before the Seven Mountains
rise above the Rhine in all their awful
majesty. The bases of the latter were yet
concealed by the woody ridge near the convent,
which gives such enchanting effect
to their a&euml;rial points. The sky above them
was clear and glowing, unstained by the
lightest vapour; and these mountains still
appeared upon it, like unsubstantial visions.
On the two highest pinnacles we could just
distinguish the ruins of castles, and, on a
lower precipice, a building, which our reverend
guide pointed out as a convent, dedicated
to St. Bernard, giving us new occasion
to admire the fine taste of the monks
in their choice of situations.</p>

<p>Opposite to the Seven Mountains, the
plains of Goodesberg are screened by the
chain of hills already mentioned, which begin
in the neighbourhood of Cologne, and
whose woods, spreading into France, there
assume the name of the Forest of Ardennes.
Within the recesses of these woods the
Elector has a hunting-seat, almost every
window of which opens upon a different
alley, and not a stag can cross these without
being seen from the chateau. It is melancholy
to consider, that the most frequent
motives of man's retirement among the
beautiful recesses of nature, are only those
of destroying the innocent animals that inhabit
her shades. Strange! that her lovely
scenes cannot soften his heart to milder
pleasures, or elevate his fancy to nobler pursuits,
and that he must still seek his amusement
in scattering death among the harmless
and the happy.</p>

<p>As we afterwards walked in the garden
of the convent, the greater part of which
was planted with vines, the monk further
exhibited his good humour and liberality.
He enquired concerning the events of the
war, of which he appeared to know the
latest; spoke of his friends in Cologne and
other places; drew a ludicrous picture of
the effect which would be produced by the
appearance of a capuchin in London, and
laughed immoderately at it. "There," said
he, "it would be supposed, that some harlequin
was walking in a capuchin's dress to
attract spectators for a pantomime; here
nobody will follow him, lest he should lead
them to church. Every nation has its way,
and laughs at the ways of others. Considering
the effects, which differences sometimes
have, there are few things more innocent
than that sort of laughter."</p>

<p>The garden was stored with fruits and
the vegetable luxuries of the table, but was
laid out with no attention to beauty, its
inimitable prospects having, as the good
monk said, rendered the society careless
of less advantages. After exchanging our
thanks for his civilities against his thanks
for the visit, we descended to Poppelsdorff
by a steep road, bordered with firs and fragrant
shrubs, which frequently opened to
corn lands and vineyards, where peasants
were busied in dressing the vines.</p>

<p>About a mile from Bonn is a garden, or
rather nursery, to which they have given
the name of <i>Vauxhall</i>. It is much more
rural than that of London, being planted
with thick and lofty groves, which, in this
climate, are gratefully refreshing, during the
summer-day, but are very pernicious in the
evening, when the vapour, arising from the
ground, cannot escape through the thick
foliage. The garden is lighted up only on
great festivals, or when the Elector or his
courtiers give a ball in a large room built
for the purpose. On some days, half the
inhabitants of Bonn are to be seen in this
garden, mingling in the promenade with
the Elector and his nobility; but there
were few visitors when we saw it. Count
<span class="smallcaps">Gimnich</span>, the commander, who had
surrendered Mentz to the French, was the only
person pointed out to us.</p>

<p>The road from hence to Bonn was laid
out and planted with poplars at the expence
of the Elector, who has a taste for works of
public advantage and ornament. His Grandmastership
of the Teutonic Order renders
his Court more frequented than those of the
other ecclesiastical Princes, the possessions of
that Order being still considerable enough
to support many younger brothers of noble
families. Having passed his youth in the
army, or at the courts of Vienna or Brussels,
he is also environed by friends, made
before the vacancy of an ecclesiastical electorate
induced him to change his profession;
and the union of his three incomes,
as Bishop of Munster, Grand Master and
Elector, enables him to spend something
more than two hundred thousand pounds
annually. His experience and revenues are,
in many respects, very usefully employed.
To the nobility he affords an example of
so much personal dignity, as to be able to
reject many ostentatious customs, and to
remove some of the ceremonial barriers,
which men do not constantly place between
themselves and their fellow-beings, except
from some consciousness of personal weakness.
All sovereigns, who have had any
sense of their individual liberty and power,
have shewn a readiness to remove such
barriers; but not many have been able to
effect so much as the Elector of Cologne
against the chamberlains, pages, and other
footmanry of their courts, who are always
upon the <i>alerte</i> to defend the false magnificence
that makes their offices seem necessary.
He now enjoys many of the
blessings, usual only in private stations;
among others, that of conversing with great
numbers of persons, not forced into his society
by their rank, and of dispensing with
much of that attendance, which would
render his menial servants part of his company.</p>

<p>His secretary, Mr. Floret, whom we had
the pleasure to see, gave us some accounts
of the industry and carefulness of his private
life, which he judiciously thought were
better than any other panegyrics upon his
master. His attention to the relief, employment
and education of the poor, to the
state of manufactures and the encouragement
of talents, appears to be continual;
and his country would soon have elapsed
from the general wretchedness of Germany,
if the exertions of three campaigns had not
destroyed what thirty years of care and improvement
cannot restore.</p>

<p>His residence at Bonn occasions expenditure
enough to keep the people busy, but
he has not been able to divert to it any part
of the commerce, which, though it is of
so little use at Cologne, is here spoken of
with some envy, and seems to be estimated
above its amount. The town, which is
much neater than the others in the electorate,
and so pleasantly situated, that its name
has been supposed to be formed from the
Latin synonym for good, is ornamented by
few public buildings, except the palace.
What is called the University is a small
brick building, used more as a school than
a college, except that the masters are called
professors. The principal church of four,
which are within the walls, is a large building,
distinguished by several spires, but not
remarkable for its antiquity or beauty.</p>

<p>Many of the German powers retain some
shew of a representative government, as to
affairs of finance, and have States, by which
taxes are voted. Those of the electorate of
Cologne consist of four colleges, representing
the clergy, nobility, knights and cities;
the votes are given by colleges, so that the
inhabitants of the cities, if they elect their
representatives fairly, have one vote in four.
These States assemble at Bonn.</p>

<p>One of the privileges, which it is surprising
that the present Elector should retain,
is that of grinding corn for the consumption
of the whole town. His mill, like
those of all the towns on the Rhine, is a
floating one, moored in the river, which
turns its wheel. Bread is bad at Bonn; but
this oppressive privilege is not entirely answerable
for it, there being little better
throughout the whole country. It generally
appears in rolls, with glazed crusts, half
hollow; the crumb not brown, but a sort of
dirty white.</p>

<p>There are few cities in Germany without
walls, which, when the dreadful science of
war was less advanced than at present, frequently
protected them against large armies.
These are now so useless, that such cannon
as are employed against batteries could
probably not be fired from them without
shaking their foundations. The fortifications
of Bonn are of this sort; and, though
they were doubtless better, when the Duke
of Marlborough arrived before them, it is
wonderful that they should have sustained
a regular siege, during which great part of
the town was demolished. The electorate
of Cologne is, indeed, so ill prepared for
war, that it has not one town, which could
resist ten thousand men for three days.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Bonn, whenever they
regret the loss of their fortifications, should
be reminded of the three sieges, which, in
the course of thirty years, nearly destroyed
their city. Of these the first was in 1673,
when the Elector had received a French
garrison into it; but the resistance did not
then continue many days. It was in this
siege that the Prince of Orange, afterwards
our honoured William the Third, had one
of his few military successes. In 1689, the
French, who had lately defended it, returned
to attack it; and, before they could
subdue the strong garrison left in it by the
Elector of Brandenburg, the palace and several
public buildings were destroyed. The
third siege was commanded by the Duke
of Marlborough, and continued from the
24th of April to the 16th of May, the
French being then the defenders, and the
celebrated Cohorn one of the assailants. It
was not till fifteen years afterwards, that all
the houses, demolished in this siege, could
be restored by the efforts of the Elector
Joseph.</p>

<p>The present Elector maintains, in time of
peace, about eight hundred soldiers, which
is the number of his contingent to the army
of the Empire: in the present war he has
supplied somewhat more than this allotment;
and, when we were at Bonn, two
thousand recruits were in training. His
troops wear the general uniform of the
Empire, blue faced with red, which many
of the Germanic sovereigns give only to
their contingent troops, while those of their
separate establishments are distinguished by
other colours. The Austrian regiments
are chiefly in white; faced with light blue,
grey, or red; but the artillery are dressed,
with very little shew, in a cloak speckled
with light brown.</p>

<p>Bonn was one of the very few places in
Germany, which we left with regret. It is
endeared to the votaries of landscape by its
situation in the midst of fruitful plains, in
the presence of stupendous mountains, and
on the bank of a river, that, in summer, is
impelled by the dissolved snows of Switzerland,
and, in winter, rolls with the accumulation
of a thousand torrents from the
rocks on its shores. It contained many inhabitants,
who had the independence to aim
at a just taste in morals and letters, in spite
of the ill examples with which such
countries supply them; and, having the vices
of the form of government, established in
it, corrected by the moderation and immediate
attention of the governor, it might
be considered as a happy region in the
midst of ignorance, injustice and misery,
and remembered like the green spot, that,
in an Arabian desert, cheers the senses and
sustains the hopes of the weary traveller.</p>

<h3><a name="GOODESBERG" id="GOODESBERG">GOODESBERG.</a></h3>

<p>The ride from Bonn to this delightful
village is only one league over a
narrow plain, covered with corn and vineyards.
On our right was the range of
hills, before seen from the mountain <span class="smallcaps">Sanct&aelig;
Crucis</span>, sweeping into frequent recesses,
and starting forward into promontories,
with inequalities, which gave exquisite
richness to the forest, that mantled from
their bases to their utmost summits. Many a
lurking village, with its slender grey steeple,
peeped from among the woody skirts of
these hills. On our left, the tremendous
mountains, that bind the eastern shore of
the Rhine, gradually lost their a&euml;rial complexion,
as we approached them, and displayed
new features and new enchantments;
an ever-varying illusion, to which
the transient circumstance of thunder clouds
contributed. The sun-beams, streaming
among these clouds, threw partial gleams
upon the precipices, and, followed by dark
shadows, gave surprising and inimitable
effect to the natural colouring of the mountains,
whose pointed tops we now discerned
to be covered with dark heath, extended
down their rocky sides, and mingled with
the reddish and light yellow tints of other
vegetation and the soil. It was delightful
to watch the shadows sweeping over these
steeps, now involving them in deep obscurity,
and then leaving them to the sun's
rays, which brought out all their hues into
vivid contrast.</p>

<p>Near Goodesberg, a small mountain, insulated,
abrupt and pyramidal, rises from
the plain, which it seems to terminate, and
conceals the village, that lies along its
southern skirt. This mountain, covered
with vineyards and thick dwarf wood to
its summit, where one high tower and some
shattered walls appear, is a very interesting
object.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the village, the road
was obstructed by a great number of small
carts, filled with soldiers apparently wounded.
The line of their procession had been
broken by some carriages, hastening with
company to the ridotto at Goodesberg, and
was not easily restored. Misery and festivity
could scarcely be brought into closer contrast.
We thought of Johnson's "many-coloured
life," and of his picture, in the
preface to Shakespeare, of cotemporary
wretchedness and joy, when "the reveller
is hastening to his wine, and the mourner
is burying his friend." This was a procession
of wounded French prisoners, chiefly
boys, whose appearance had, indeed, led us
to suspect their nation, before we saw the
stamp of the <i>fasces</i>, and the words "<i>Republique
Fran&ccedil;oise</i>" upon the buttons of
some, whom our driver had nearly overset.
The few, that could raise themselves above
the floor of their carts, shewed countenances
yellow, or livid with sickness. They did
not talk to their guards, nor did the latter
shew any signs of exultation over them.</p>

<p>In a plain, beyond the village, a row of
large houses, built upon one plan, and almost
resembling a palace, form the little
watering place of Goodesberg, which has
been founded partly at the expence of the
Elector, and partly by individuals under
his patronage. One of the houses was occupied
by the Archduchess, his sister, and
is often used by the Elector, who is extremely
solicitous for the prosperity of the
place. A large building at the end contains
the public rooms, and is fitted up as an
hotel.</p>

<p>The situation of this house is beautiful
beyond any hope or power of description;
for description, though it may tell that
there are mountains and rocks, cannot
paint the grandeur, or the elegance of outline,
cannot give the effect of precipices, or
draw the minute features, that reward the
actual observer by continual changes of
colour, and by varying their forms at every
new choice of his position. Delightful
Goodesberg! the sublime and beautiful of
landscape, the charms of music, and the
pleasures of gay and elegant society, were
thine! The immediate unhappiness of war
has now fallen upon thee; but, though the
graces may have fled thee, thy terrible majesty
remains, beyond the sphere of human
contention.</p>

<p>The plain, that contains the village and
the spa, is about five miles in length and
of half that breadth. It is covered by uninclosed
corn, and nearly surrounded by a
vast amphitheatre of mountains. In front
of the inn, at the distance of half a league,
extend, along the opposite shore of the
Rhine, the Seven Mountains, so long seen
and admired, which here assume a new attitude.
The three tallest points are now
nearest to the eye, and the lower mountains
are seen either in the perspective between
them, or sinking, with less abrupt declivities,
into the plains, on the north. The
whole mass exhibits a grandeur of outline,
such as the pencil only can describe; but
fancy may paint the stupendous precipices
of rock, that rise over the Rhine, the rich
tuftings of wood, that emboss the cliffs or
lurk within the recesses, the spiry summits
and the ruined castles, faintly discerned,
that crown them. Yet the appearance of
these mountains, though more grand, from
Goodesberg, is less sublime than from
Bonn; for the nearness, which increases
their grandeur, diminishes their sublimity
by removing the obscurity that had veiled
them. To the south of this plain, the long
perspective is crossed by further ranges of
mountains, which open to glimpses of others
still beyond; an endless succession of summits,
that lead on the imagination to unknown
vallies and regions of solitary obscurity.</p>

<p>Amidst so many attractions of nature, art
cannot do much. The little, which it attempts,
at Goodesberg, is the disposition of
some walks from the houses to a spring,
which is said to resemble that at Spa, and
through the woods above it. Twice a week
there are some musical performances and a
ball given by the Elector, who frequently
appears, and with the ease and plainness of
a private gentleman. At these entertainments
the company, visiting the spring, are
joined by neighbouring families, so as to be
in number sixty, or a hundred. The balls,
agreeably to the earliness of German hours,
begin at six; and that, which we meant
to see, was nearly concluded before our arrival.
The company then retired to a public
game, at which large sums of gold were
risked, and a severe anxiety defied the influence
of Mozart's music, that continued
to be played by an excellent orchestra.
The dresses of the company were in the
English taste, and, as we were glad to believe,
chiefly of English manufacture; the
wearing of countenances by play appears
to be also according to our manners; and
the German ladies, with features scarcely
less elegant, have complexions, perhaps,
finer than are general in England.</p>

<p>Meditating censures against the Elector's
policy, or carelessness, in this respect, we
took advantage of the last gleams of evening,
to ascend the slender and spiry mountain,
which bears the name of the village,
and appears ready to precipitate the ruins
of its antient castle upon it. A steep road,
winding among vineyards and dwarf wood,
enters, at the summit of the mountain, the
broken walls, which surround the antient
citadel of the castle; an almost solid building,
that has existed for more than five
centuries. From the area of these ruins we
saw the sun set over the whole line of
plains, that extend to the westward of Cologne,
whose spires were distinctly visible.
Bonn, and the hill <span class="smallcaps">Sanct&aelig; Crucis</span>, appeared
at a league's distance, and the windings
of the Rhine gleamed here and there
amidst the rich scene, like distant lakes. It
was a still and beautiful evening, in which
no shade remained of the thunder clouds,
that passed in the day. To the west, under
the glow of sun-set, the landscape melted
into the horizon in tints so soft, so clear,
so delicately roseate as Claude only could
have painted. Viewed, as we then saw it,
beyond a deep and dark arch of the ruin,
its effect was enchanting; it was to the
eye, what the finest strains of Paisiello are
to the heart, or the poetry of Collins is to
the fancy&mdash;all tender, sweet, elegant and
glowing.</p>

<p>From the other side of the hill the character
of the view is entirely different, and,
instead of a long prospect over an open and
level country, the little plain of Goodesberg
appears reposing amidst wild and awful
mountains. These were now melancholy
and silent; the last rays were fading from
their many points, and the obscurity of
twilight began to spread over them. We
seemed to have found the spot, for which
Collins wished:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
"Now let me rove some wild and heathy scene,<br />
Or find some ruin 'midst its dreary dells,<br />
Whose walls more awful nod<br />
By thy religious gleams."
</p>
</div>
<p class="right"><span class="smallcaps">Ode to Evening.</span><br /></p>

<p>And this is a place almost as renowned
in the history of the country, as it is worthy
to exercise the powers of poetry and painting.
The same Ernest, in the cause of
whose sovereignty the massacre of Neuss
was perpetrated, besieged here the same
Gerard de Trusches, the Elector, who had
embraced the Protestant religion, and for
whom Neuss held out. The castle of
Goodesberg was impregnable, except by
famine, but was very liable to that from
its insulated situation, and the ease, with
which the whole base of the mountain
could be surrounded. Gerard's defence was
rendered the more obstinate by his belief,
that nothing less than his life, and that of a
beautiful woman, the marrying of whom
had constituted one of the offences against
his Chapter, would appease his ferocious
enemies. He was personally beloved by
his garrison, and they adhered to him with
the affection of friends, as well as with the
enthusiasm of soldiers. When, therefore,
they perceived, that their surrender could
not be much longer protracted, they resolved
to employ their remaining time and
strength in enabling him to separate his
fortunes from theirs. They laboured incessantly
in forming a subterraneous passage,
which should open beyond the besiegers'
lines; and, though their distress became
extreme before this was completed, they
made no overtures for a surrender, till
Gerard and his wife had escaped by it.
The fugitives arrived safely in Holland, and
the vengeance of their adversaries was never
gratified further than by hearing, many
years after, that they died poor.</p>

<p>The fortress, rendered interesting by
these traits of fidelity and misfortune, is
not so far decayed, but that its remains exhibit
much of its original form. It covered
the whole summit of the hill, and was valuable
as a residence, as well as a fortification.
What seem to have been the walls
of the great hall, in which probably the
horn of two quarts was often emptied to
welcome the guest, or reward the soldier,
are still perfect enough to preserve the
arches of its capacious windows, and the
doorways, that admitted its festive trains.
The vast strength of the citadel has been
unsubdued by war, or time. Though the
battlements, that crown it, are broken, and
of a gallery, that once encircled it half way
from the ground, the corbells alone remain,
the solid walls of the building itself
are unimpaired. At the narrow doorway,
by which only it could be entered, we
measured their thickness, and found it to be
more than ten feet, nearly half the diameter
of its area. There has never been a
fixed staircase, though these walls would so
well have contained one; and the hole is
still perfect in the floor above, through
which the garrison ascended, and drew up
their ladder after them. Behind the loopholes,
the wall has been hollowed, and
would permit a soldier, half bent, to stand
within them and use his bow. It was
twilight without and night within the edifice;
which fancy might have easily filled
with the stern and silent forms of warriors,
waiting for their prey, with the patience of
safety and sure superiority.</p>

<p>We wandered long among these vestiges
of ancient story, rendered still more interesting
by the shadowy hour and the vesper
bell of a chapel on a cliff below. The
village, to which this belongs, straggles half
way up the mountain, and there are several
little shrines above it, which the cottagers,
on festivals, decorate with flowers. The
Priest is the schoolmaster of the parish, and
almost all the children, within several miles
of the hill, walk to it, every day, to prayers
and lessons. Whether it is from this care
of their minds, or that they are under
the authority of milder landlords than elsewhere,
the manners of the inhabitants in
this plain differ much from those, usual in
Germany. Instead of an inveterate sullenness,
approaching frequently to malignity,
they shew a civility and gentleness in their
intercourse with strangers, which leave the
enjoyments derived from inanimate nature,
unalloyed by the remembrances of human
deformity, that mingle with them in other
districts. Even the children's begging is in
a manner, which shews a different character.
They here kiss their little hands, and silently
hold them out to you, almost as much
in salute, as in entreaty; in many parts of
Germany their manner is so offensive, not
only for its intrusion, but as a symptom of
their disposition, that nothing but the remembrance
of the oppression, that produces
it, can prevent you from denying the little
they are compelled to require.</p>

<p>The music had not ceased, when we returned
to the inn; and the mellowness of
French horns, mingled with the tenderness
of hautboys, gave a kind of enchantment
to the scenery, which we continued to
watch from our windows. The opposite
mountains of the Rhine were gradually
vanishing in twilight and then as gradually
re-appearing, as the rising moon threw
her light upon their broken surfaces. The
perspective in the east received a silvery
softness, which made its heights appear like
shadowy illusions, while the nearer mountains
were distinguished by their colouring,
as much as by their forms. The broad
Rhine, at their feet, rolled a stream of light
for their boundary, on this side. But the
first exquisite tint of beauty soon began to
fade; the mountains became misty underneath
the moon, and, as she ascended, these
mists thickened, till they veiled the landscape
from our view.</p>

<p>The spring, which is supposed to have
some medicinal qualities, is about a quarter
of a mile from the rooms, in a woody valley,
in which the Elector has laid out several
roads and walks. It rises in a stone
bason, to which the company, if they wish
to drink it on the spot, descend by an
handsome flight of steps. We were not
told its qualities, but there is a ferrugineous
tint upon all the stones, which it touches.
The taste is slightly unpleasant.</p>

<p>The three superior points of the Seven
Mountains, which contribute so much to
the distinction of Goodesberg, are called
Drakenfels, Wolkenbourg and Lowenbourg,
and have each been crowned by its castle,
of which two are still visible in ruins.
There is a story faintly recorded, concerning
them. Three brothers, resolving to
found three distinguished families, took the
method, which was anciently in use for
such a purpose, that of establishing themselves
in fortresses, from whence they could
issue out, and take what they wanted from
their industrious neighbours. The pinnacles
of Drakenfels, Wolkenbourg and Lowenbourg,
which, with all assistance, cannot
be ascended now, without the utmost
fatigue, were inaccessible, when guarded by
the castles, built by the three brothers.
Their depredations, which they called successes
in war, enriched their families, and
placed them amongst the most distinguished
in the Empire.</p>

<p>They had a sister, named Adelaide,
famed to have been very beautiful; and,
their parents being dead, the care of her
had descended to them. Roland, a young
knight, whose castle was on the opposite
bank of the Rhine, became her suitor, and
gained her affections. Whether the brothers
had expected, by her means, to form
a more splendid alliance, or that they remembered
the ancient enmity between
their family and that of Roland, they secretly
resolved to deny the hand of Adelaide,
but did not choose to provoke him by
a direct refusal. They stipulated, that he
should serve, a certain number of years, in
the war of Palestine, and, on his return,
should be permitted to renew his suit.</p>

<p>Roland took a reluctant farewell of Adelaide,
and went to the war, where he was
soon distinguished for an impetuous career.
Adelaide remained in the castle of Drakenfels,
waiting, in solitary fidelity, for his
return. But the brothers had determined,
that he should not return for her. They
clothed one of their dependents in the disguise
of a pilgrim, and introduced him into
the castle, where he related that he was
arrived from the holy wars, and had been
desired by Roland in his latest moments to
assure Adelaide of his having loved her till
death.</p>

<p>The unhappy Adelaide believed the tale,
and, from that time, devoted herself to the
memory of Roland and to the nourishment
of her sorrow. She rejected all the suitors,
introduced by her brothers, and accepted
no society, but that of some neighbouring
nuns. At length, the gloom of a cloister
became so necessary to the melancholy of
her imagination, that she resolved to found
a convent and take the veil; a design,
which her brothers assisted, with the view
of placing her effectually beyond the reach
of her lover. She chose an island in the
Rhine between her brother's castle and the
seat of Roland, both of which she could
see from the windows of her convent; and
here she passed some years in the placid
performance of her new duties.</p>

<p>At length, Roland returned, and they
both discovered the cruel device, by which
they had been separated for ever. Adelaide
remained in her convent, and soon after
died; but Roland, emulating the fidelity
of her retirement, built, at the extreme
point of his domains towards the Rhine,
a small castle, that overlooked the island,
where he wasted his days in melancholy
regret, and in watching over the walls, that
shrouded his Adelaide.</p>

<p>This is the story, on which the wild
and vivid imagination of Ariosto is said to
have founded his Orlando.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="THE_VALLEY_OF_ANDERNACH" id="THE_VALLEY_OF_ANDERNACH">THE VALLEY OF ANDERNACH.</a></h3>

<p>After spending part of two days
at Goodesberg, we set out, in a sultry afternoon,
for the town of Andernach,
distant about five-and-twenty English miles.
The road wound among corn-lands towards
the Rhine, and approached almost as near
to the Seven Mountains, as the river would
permit. Opposite to the last, and nearly
the tallest of these, called Drakenfels, the
open plain terminates, and the narrower
valley begins.</p>

<p>This mountain towers, the majestic sentinel
of the river over which it aspires, in vast
masses of rock, varied with rich tuftings of
dwarf-wood, and bearing on its narrow
peak the remains of a castle, whose walls
seem to rise in a line with the perpendicular
precipice, on which they stand, and, when
viewed from the opposite bank, appear little
more than a rugged cabin. The eye aches
in attempting to scale this rock; but the
sublimity of its height and the grandeur of
its intermingled cliffs and woods gratify the
warmest wish of fancy.</p>

<p>The road led us along the western bank
of the Rhine among vineyards, and corn,
and thick trees, that allowed only transient
catches of the water between their branches;
but the gigantic form of Drakenfels was
always seen, its superior features, perhaps,
appearing more wild, from the partial concealment
of its base, and assuming new attitudes
as we passed away from it. Lowenberg,
whose upper region only had been
seen from Goodesberg, soon unfolded itself
from behind Drakenfels, and displayed all
its pomp of wood, sweeping from the
spreading base in one uninterrupted line of
grandeur to the spiry top, on which one
high tower of the castle appears enthroned
among the forests. This is the loftiest of
the Seven Mountains; and its dark sides,
where no rock is visible, form a fine contrast
with the broken cliffs of Drakenfels.
A multitude of spiry summits appeared beyond
Lowenberg, seen and lost again, as
the nearer rocks of the shore opened to the
distance, or re-united. About a mile further,
lies the pleasant island, on which
Adelaide raised her convent. As it was well
endowed, it has been rebuilt, and is now a
large and handsome quadrangle of white
stone, surrounded with trees, and corn, and
vineyards, and still allotted to the society,
which she established. An abrupt, but not
lofty rock, on the western shore of the
Rhine, called Rolands Eck, or Roland's
Corner, is the site of her lover's castle, of
which one arch, picturesquely shadowed
with wood, is all that remains of this monument
to faithful love. The road winds
beneath it, and nearly overhangs the narrow
channel, that separates Adelaide's island
from the shore. Concerning this rock there
is an antient rhyme in the country, amounting
to something like the following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="small">Was not Roland, the knight, a strange silly wight,</span><br />
<span class="small">For the love of a nun, to live on this height?</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>After passing the island, the valley contracts,
and the river is soon shut up between
fruitful and abrupt hills, which rise immediately
over it, on one side, and a series of
rocky heights on the other. In the small
space, left between these heights and the
Rhine, the road is formed. For the greater
part of the way, it has been hollowed in
the solid rock, which ascends almost perpendicularly
above it, on one hand, and
sinks as abruptly below it, to the river, on
the other; a work worthy of Roman perseverance
and design, and well known to
be a monument of both. It was made
during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius Verus; and as the inscription,
whose antiquity has not been doubted, dates
its completion in the year 162, it must have
been finished in one year, or little more,
Marcus Aurelius having been raised to
the purple in 161. The Elector Palatine
having repaired this road, which the
Electors of Cologne had neglected, in 1768, has
caused his name to be joined with those of
the Roman Emperors, in the following inscription
upon an obelisk:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">VIAM<br />

ET AMPLIAVIT<br />
AN. M.DCCLXVIII<br />
CURANTE JO. LUD. COMITE<br />

PRO PRINCIPE.
</p>
</div>

<p>We did not sufficiently observe the commencement
and conclusion of this road, to
be certain of its exact length; but it is
probably about twelve miles. The rock above
is, for the most part, naked to the summit,
where it is thinly covered with earth;
but sometimes it slopes so much as to
permit patches of soil on its side, and
these are carefully planted with vines.
This shore of the Rhine may be said to
be bounded, for many miles, by an immense
wall of rock, through which the
openings into the country behind are few;
and these breaks shew only deep glens, seen
and lost again so quickly, that a woody
mountain, or a castle, or a convent, were
the only objects we could ascertain.</p>

<p>This rock lies in oblique <i>strata</i>, and resembles
marble in its brown and reddish
tints, marked with veins of deeper red; but
we are unable to mention it under its
proper and scientific denomination. The
colouring of the cliffs is beautiful, when
mingled with the verdure of shrubs, that
sometimes hang in rich drapery from their
points, and with the mosses, and creeping
vegetables of bright crimson, yellow, and
purple, that emboss their fractured sides.</p>

<p>The road, which the Elector mentions
himself to have widened, is now and then
very narrow, and approaches near enough
to the river, over which it has no parapet,
to make a traveller anxious for the sobriety
and skill of his postillion. It is sometimes
elevated forty feet above the level of the
Rhine, and seldom less than thirty; an elevation
from whence the water and its
scenery are viewed to great advantage; but
to the variety and grandeur of these shores,
and the ever-changing form of the river,
description cannot do justice.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as we approached a rocky
point, we seemed going to plunge into the
expanse of water beyond; when, turning
the sharp angle of the promontory, the
road swept along an ample bay, where the
rocks, receding, formed an amphitheatre,
covered with <i>ilex</i> and dwarf-wood, round
a narrow, but cultivated level stripe: then,
winding the furthest angle of this crescent,
under huge cliffs, we saw the river beyond,
shut in by the folding bases of more distant
promontories, assume the form of a lake,
amidst wild and romantic landscapes. Having
doubled one of these capes, the prospect
opened in long perspective, and the green
waters of the Rhine appeared in all their
majesty, flowing rapidly between ranges of
marbled rocks, and a succession of woody
steeps, and overlooked by a multitude of
spiry summits, which distance had sweetly
coloured with the blue and purple tints of
air.</p>

<p>The retrospect of the river, too, was
often enchanting, and the Seven Mountains
long maintained their dignity in the scene,
superior to many intervening heights; the
dark summit of Lowenbourg, in particular,
appeared, for several leagues, overlooking
the whole valley of the Rhine.</p>

<p>The eastern margin of the river sometimes
exhibited as extensive a range of steep
rocks as the western, and frequently the
fitness of the salient angles on one side, to
the recipient ones on the other, seemed to
justify the speculation, that they had been
divided by an earthquake, which let the
river in between them. The general state
of the eastern bank, though steep, is that
of the thickest cultivation. The rock frequently
peeps, in rugged projections,
through the thin soil, which is scattered
over its declivity, and every where appears
at top; but the sides are covered with vines
so abundantly, that the labour of cultivating
them, and of expressing the wine, supports
a village at least at every half mile. The
green rows are led up the steeps to an
height, which cannot be ascended without
the help of steps cut in the rock: the soil
itself is there supported by walls of loose
stones, or it would fall either by its own
weight, or with the first pressure of rain;
and sometimes even this scanty mould appears
to have been placed there by art, being
in such small patches, that, perhaps, only
twenty vines can be planted in each. But
such excessive labour has been necessary
only towards the summits, for, lower down,
the soil is sufficiently deep to support the
most luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>It might be supposed from so much produce
and exertion, that this bank of the
Rhine is the residence of an opulent, or,
at least, a well-conditioned peasantry, and
that the villages, of which seven or eight
are frequently in sight at once, are as superior
to the neighbouring towns by the
state of their inhabitants, as they are by
their picturesque situation. On the contrary,
the inhabitants of the wine country
are said to be amongst the poorest in Germany.
The value of every hill is exactly
watched by the landlords, so that the tenants
are very seldom benefited by any improvement
of its produce. If the rent is paid in
money, it leaves only so much in the hands
of the farmer as will enable him to live,
and pay his workmen; while the attention
of a great number of stewards is supposed
to supply what might be expected from his
attention, had he a common interest with
his landlord in the welfare of the estate.
But the rent is frequently paid in kind,
amounting to a settled proportion of the
produce; and this proportion is so fixed,
that, though the farmer is immoderately
distressed by a bad vintage, the best will not
afford him any means of approaching to independence.
In other countries it might
be asked, "But, though we can suppose the
ingenuity of the landlord to be greater than
that of the tenant, at the commencement of
a bargain, how happens it, that, since the
result must be felt, the tenant will remain
under his burthens, or can be succeeded by
any other, on such terms?" Here, however,
these questions are not applicable; they
presume a choice of situations, which the
country does not afford. The severity of
the agricultural system continues itself by
continuing the poverty, upon which it acts;
and those who would escape from it find
few manufactures and little trade to employ
them, had they the capital and the education
necessary for either. The choice of
such persons is between the being a master
of day-labourers for their landlord, or a
labourer under other masters.</p>

<p>Many of these estates belong immediately
to Princes, or Chapters, whose stewards superintend
the cultivation, and are themselves
instead of the farmers, so that all other persons
employed in such vineyards are ordinary
servants. By one or other of these
means it happens, that the bounteousness of
nature to the country is very little felt by
the body of the inhabitants. The payment
of rents in kind is usual, wherever the vineyards
are most celebrated; and, at such
places, there is this sure proof of the wretchedness
of the inhabitants, that, in a month
after the wine is made, you cannot obtain
one bottle of the true produce, except by
favour of the proprietors, or their stewards.
How much is the delight of looking upon
plenteousness lessened by the belief, that it
supplies the means of excess to a few, but
denies those of competence to many!</p>

<p>Between this pass of cultivated steeps on
one side of the river, and of romantic rocks
on the other, the road continues for several
miles. Being thus commanded on both
sides, it must be one of the most difficult
passages in Europe to an enemy, if resolutely
defended. The Rhine, pent between
these impenetrable boundaries, is considerably
narrower here than in other parts of the
valley, and so rapid, that a loaded vessel can
seldom be drawn faster than at the rate of
six English miles a day, against the stream.
The passage down the river from Mentz to
Cologne may be easily performed in two
days; that from Cologne to Mentz requires
a fortnight.</p>

<p>The view along this pass, though bounded,
is various and changeful. Villages,
vineyards and rocks alternately ornament
the borders of the river, and every fifty
yards enable the eye to double some massy
projection that concealed the fruitful bay
behind. An object at the end of the pass
is presented singly to the sight as through
an inverted telescope. The surface of the
water, or the whole stillness of the scene,
was very seldom interrupted by the passing
of a boat; carriages were still fewer; and,
indeed, throughout Germany, you will not
meet more than one in twenty miles.
Travelling is considered by the natives, who
know the fatigue of going in carriages nearly
without springs, and stopping at inns
where there is little of either accommodation
or civility, as productive of no pleasure;
and they have seldom curiosity or
business enough to recompense for its inconveniences.</p>

<p>We passed through two or three small
towns, whose ruined gates and walls told of
their antiquity, and that they had once been
held of some consequence in the defence of
the valley. Their present desolation formed
a melancholy contrast with the cheerful cultivation
around them. These, however,
with every village in our way, were decorated
with green boughs, planted before
the door of each cottage, for it was a day
of festival. The little chapels at the road-side,
and the image, which, every now and
then, appeared under a spreading tree, were
adorned with wreaths of fresh flowers;
and though one might smile at the emblems
of superstition, it was impossible not
to reverence the sentiment of pious affection,
which had adjusted these simple ornaments.</p>

<p>About half-way to Andernach, the western
rocks suddenly recede from the river,
and, rising to greater height, form a grand
sweep round a plain cultivated with orchards,
garden-fields, corn and vineyards.
The valley here spreads to a breadth of
nearly a mile and an half, and exhibits
grandeur, beauty and barren sublimity,
united in a singular manner. The abrupt
steeps, that rise over this plain, are entirely
covered with wood, except that here and
there the ravage of a winter torrent appeared,
which could sometimes be traced from
the very summit of the acclivity to the base.
Near the centre, this noble amphitheatre
opens to a glen, that shews only wooded
mountains, point above point, in long
perspective; such sylvan pomp we had seldom
seen! But though the tuftings of the nearer
woods were beautifully luxuriant, there
seemed to be few timber trees amongst
them. The opposite shore exhibited only
a range of rocks, variegated like marble, of
which purple was the predominating tint,
and uniformly disposed in vast, oblique
strata. But even here, little green patches
of vines peeped among the cliffs, and were
led up crevices where it seemed as if no
human foot could rest. Along the base of
this tremendous wall, and on the points
above, villages, with each its tall, grey
steeple, were thickly strewn, thus mingling
in striking contrast the cheerfulness of populous
inhabitation with the horrors of untamed
nature. A few monasteries, resembling
castles in their extent, and known
from such only by their spires, were distinguishable;
and, in the widening perspective
of the Rhine, an old castle itself, now and
then, appeared on the summit of a mountain
somewhat remote from the shore; an
object rendered sweetly picturesque, as the
sun's rays lighted up its towers and fortified
terraces, while the shrubby steeps below
were in shade.</p>

<p>We saw this landscape under the happiest
circumstances of season and weather; the
woods and plants were in their midsummer
bloom, and the mellow light of evening
heightened the richness of their hues, and
gave exquisite effect to one half of the amphitheatre
we were passing, while the other
half was in shadow. The air was scented
by bean-blossoms, and by lime-trees then in
flower, that bordered the road. If this
plain had mingled pasture with its groves,
it would have been truly Arcadian; but
neither here, nor through the whole of this
delightful valley, did we see a single pasture
or meadow, except now and then in
an island on the Rhine; deficiencies which
are here supplied, to the lover of landscape,
by the verdure of the woods and vines.
In other parts of Germany they are more
to be regretted, where, frequently, only
corn and rock colour the land.</p>

<p>Fatigued at length by such prodigality of
beauty, we were glad to be shrouded awhile
from the view of it, among close boughs,
and to see only the wide rivulets, with their
rustic bridges of faggots and earth, that,
descending from among the mountains, frequently
crossed our way; or the simple
peasant-girl, leading her cows to feed on the
narrow stripe of grass that margined the
road. The little bells, that jingled at their
necks, would not suffer them to stray beyond
her hearing. If we had not long
since dismissed our surprise at the scarcity
and bad quality of cheese and butter in
Germany, we should have done so now, on
perceiving this scanty method of pasturing
the cattle, which future observation convinced
us was the frequent practice.</p>

<p>About sun-set we reached the little village
of Namedy, seated near the foot of a rock,
round which the Rhine makes a sudden
sweep, and, contracted by the bold precipices
of Hammerstein on the opposite shore,
its green current passes with astonishing rapidity
and sounding strength. These circumstances
of scenery, with the tall masts
of vessels lying below the shrubby bank,
on which the village stands, and seeming to
heighten by comparison the stupendous
rocks, that rose around them; the moving
figures of boatmen and horses employed in
towing a barge against the stream, in the
bay beyond; and a group of peasants on
the high quay, in the fore ground, watching
their progress; the ancient castle of
Hammerstein overlooking the whole&mdash;these
were a combination of images, that formed
one of the most interesting pictures we had
seen.</p>

<p>The valley again expanding, the walls
and turrets of Andernach, with its Roman
tower rising independently at the foot of
a mountain, and the ruins of its castle above,
appeared athwart the perspective of the
river, terminating the pass; for there the
rocky boundary opened to plains and remote
mountains. The light vapour, that
rose from the water, and was tinged by the
setting rays, spread a purple haze over the
town and the cliffs, which, at this distance,
appeared to impend over it; colouring extremely
beautiful, contrasted as it was by
the clearer and deeper tints of rocks, wood
and water nearer to the eye.</p>

<p>As we approached Andernach, its situation
seemed to be perpetually changing,
with the winding bank. Now it appeared
seated on a low peninsula, that nearly
crossed the Rhine, overhung by romantic
rocks; but this vision vanished as we advanced,
and we perceived the town lying
along a curving shore, near the foot of the
cliffs, which were finely fringed with wood,
and at the entrance of extensive plains.
Its towers seen afar, would be signs of a
considerable place, to those who had not
before been wearied of such symptoms by
the towers of Neuss, and other German
towns. From a wooded precipice over the
river we had soon after a fine retrospective
glimpse of the valley, its fantastic shores,
and long mountainous distance, over which
evening had drawn her sweetest colouring.
As we pursued the pass, the heights on
either hand gradually softened; the country
beyond shewed remote mountains less wild
and aspiring than those we had left, and
the blooming tint, which had invested the
distance, deepened to a dusky purple, and
then vanished in the gloom of twilight.
The progressive influence of the hour upon
the landscape was interesting; and the
shade of evening, under which we entered
Andernach, harmonized with the desolation
and silence of its old walls and the broken
ground around them. We passed a drawbridge
and a ruinous gateway, and were
sufficiently fatigued to be somewhat anxious
as to our accommodation. The English
habit of considering, towards the end of the
day's journey, that you are not far from
the cheerful reception, the ready attendance,
and the conveniences of a substantial inn,
will soon be lost in Germany. There, instead
of being in good spirits, during the
last stage, from such a prospect, you have to
consider, whether you shall find a room,
not absolutely disgusting, or a house with
any eatable provision, or a landlady, who
will give it you, before the delay and the
fatigue of an hundred requests have rendered
you almost incapable of receiving it.
When your carriage stops at the inn, you
will perhaps perceive, instead of the alacrity
of an English waiter, or the civility
of an English landlord, a huge figure, wrapt
in a great coat, with a red worsted cap on
his head, and a pipe in his mouth, stalking
before the door. This is the landlord. He
makes no alteration in his pace on perceiving
you, or, if he stops, it is to eye you
with curiosity; he seldom speaks, never
bows, or assists you to alight; and perhaps
stands surrounded by a troop of slovenly
girls, his daughters, whom the sound of
wheels has brought to the door, and who,
as they lean indolently against it, gaze at
you with rude curiosity and surprise.</p>

<p>The drivers in Germany are all bribed
by the innkeepers, and, either by affecting
to misunderstand you, or otherwise, will
constantly stop at the door, where they are
best paid. That this money comes out of
your pocket the next morning is not the
grievance; the evil is, that the worst inns
give them the most, and a traveller, unless
he exactly remembers his directions, is
liable to be lodged in all the vilest rooms
of a country, where the best hotels have no
lodging so clean and no larder so wholesomely
filled as those of every half-way
house between London and Canterbury.
When you are within the inn, the landlord,
who is eager to keep, though not to accommodate
you, will affirm, that his is the inn
you ask for, or that the other sign is not
in the place; and, as you soon learn to believe
any thing of the wretchedness of the
country, you are unwilling to give up one
lodging, lest you should not find another.</p>

<p>Our driver, after passing a desolate, half
filled place, into which the gate of Andernach
opened, entered a narrow passage,
which afterwards appeared to be one of
the chief streets of the place. Here he
found a miserable inn, and declared that
there was no other; but, as we had seen
one of a much better appearance, we were
at length brought to that, and, though with
some delay, were not ill accommodated, for
the night.</p>

<p>Andernach is an antient town, and it is
believed, that a tower, which stands alone,
at one end of the walls, was built by
Drusus, of whom there are many traces in
walls and castles, intended to defend the
colonies, on this side of the Rhine, against
the Germans, on the other. The fortifications
can now be of little other use than to
authorise the toll, which travellers pay, for
entering a walled town; a tax, on account
of which many of the walls are supported,
though it is pretended, that the tax is to
support the walls. By their means also, the
Elector of Cologne collects here the last
of four payments, which he demands for
the privilege of passing the Rhine from
Urdingen to Andernach; and this is the
most Southern frontier town of his
dominions on the western side of the Rhine,
which soon after join those of the Elector
of Treves. Their length from hence to
Rheinberg is not less than ninety miles;
the breadth probably never more than
twenty.</p>

<p>There is some trade, at Andernach, in
tiles, timber, and mill-stones, but the heaps
of these commodities upon the beach are
the only visible symptoms of the traffick;
for you will not see one person in the place
moving as if he had business to attract him,
or one shop of a better appearance, than an
English huckster's, or one man in the dress
of a creditable trader, or one house, which
can be supposed to belong to persons in
easy circumstances. The port contains, perhaps,
half a dozen vessels, clinker built, in
shape between a barge and a sloop; on the
quay, you may see two or three fellows,
harnessing half a dozen horses to a tow line,
while twenty more watch their lingering
man&oelig;uvres, and this may probably be the
morning's business of the town. Those,
who are concerned in it, say that they are
engaged in <i>commerce</i>.</p>

<p>This, or something like it, is the condition,
as to trade, of all the towns we saw in
Germany, one or two excepted. They are
so far from having well filled, or spacious
repositories, that you can scarcely tell at
what houses there are any, till you are led
within the door; you may then wait long
after you are heard, or seen, before the
owner, if he has any other engagement,
thinks it necessary to approach you: if he
has what you ask for, which he probably
has not, unless it is something very ordinary,
he tells the price and takes it, with as
much sullenness, as if you were forcing the
goods from him: if he has not, and can
shew you only something very different, he
then considers your enquiry as an intrusion,
and appears to think himself injured by
having had the trouble to answer you.
What seems unaccountable in the manners
of a German trader, is, that, though he is
so careless in attending you, he looks as
much distressed, as vexed, if you do not
leave some money with him; but he probably
knows, that you can be supplied no
where else in the town, and, therefore, will
not deny himself the indulgence of his temper.
Even when you are satisfied, his manner
is so ill, that he appears to consider you
his dependent, by wanting something which
he can refuse. After perceiving, that this
is nearly general, the pain of making continual
discoveries of idleness and malignity
becomes so much greater than the inconvenience
of wanting any thing short of necessaries,
that you decline going into shops,
and wait for some easier opportunities of
supplying whatever you may lose upon the
road.</p>

<h3><a name="X-COBLENTZ" id="X-COBLENTZ">COBLENTZ.</a></h3>

<p>It is one post from Andernach hither,
over a road, as good as any in England.
Beyond the dominions of the Elector
of Cologne, the face of the country, on
this side of the Rhine, entirely changes its
character. The rocks cease, at Andernach,
and a rich plain commences, along which
the road is led, at a greater distance from
the Rhine, through corn lands and uninclosed
orchards. About a mile from Andernach,
on the other side of the river, the
white town of Neuwiedt, the capital of a
small Protestant principality, is seen; and
the general report, that it is one of the most
commercial places, on the Rhine, appeared
to be true from the cheerful neatness of the
principal street, which faces towards the
water. There were also about twenty small
vessels, lying before it, and the quay seemed
to be wide enough to serve as a spacious
terrace to the houses. The Prince's palace,
an extensive stone building, with a lofty
orangery along the shore, is at the end of
this street, which, as well as the greatest
part of the town, was built, or improved
under the auspices of his father; a wise
prince, distinguished by having negotiated,
in 1735, a peace between the Empire and
France, when the continuance of the war
had seemed to be inevitable. The same
benevolence led him to a voluntary surrender
of many oppressive privileges over his
subjects, as well as to the most careful protection
of commerce and manufactures.
Accordingly, the town of Neuwiedt has
been continually increasing in prosperity
and size, for the last fifty years, and the
inhabitants of the whole principality are said
to be as much more qualified in their characters
as they are happier in their conditions
than those of the neighbouring states.
But then there is the <i>wretchedness</i> of a deficiency
of game in the country, for the late
Prince was guilty of such an innovation as
to mitigate the severity of the laws respecting
it.</p>

<p>The forest hills, that rise behind Neuwiedt
and over the rocky margin of the
river, extend themselves towards the more
rugged mountains of Wetteravia, which are
seen, a shapeless multitude, in the east.</p>

<p>The river is soon after lost to the view
between high, sedgy banks; but, near Coblentz,
the broad bay, which it makes in
conjunction with the Moselle, is seen expanding
between the walls of the city and
the huge pyramidal precipice, on which
stands the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, or rather
which is itself formed into that fortress.
The Moselle is here a noble river, by which
the streams of a thousand hills, covered with
vines, pour themselves into the Rhine.
The antient stone bridge over it leads to the
northern gate of Coblentz, and the entrance
into the city is ornamented by several large
chateau-like mansions, erected to command
a view of the two rivers. A narrow street
of high, but antient houses then commences,
and runs through the place. Those, which
branch from it, extend, on each side, towards
the walls, immediately within which there
are others, that nearly follow their course
and encompass the city. Being built between
two rivers, its form is triangular, and
only one side is entirely open to the land;
a situation so convenient both for the purposes
of commerce and war, that it could
not be overlooked by the Romans, and was
not much neglected by the moderns, till
the industry of maritime countries and the
complicated constitution of the Empire reduced
Germany in the scale of nations.
This was accordingly the station of the first
legion, and the union of the two rivers gave
it a name; <i>Confluentia</i>. At the commencement
of the modern division of nations, the
successors of Charlemagne frequently resided
here, for the convenience of an intercourse
between the other parts of the Empire and
France; but, in the eleventh century, the
whole territory of Treves regained the distinction,
as a separate country, which the
Romans had given it, by calling the inhabitants
<i>Treveri</i>.</p>

<p>Coblentz is a city of many spires, and has
establishments of chapters and monasteries,
which make the great pride of German
capitals, and are sometimes the chief objects,
that could distinguish them from the neglected
villages of other countries. The
streets are not all narrow, but few of them
are straight; and the same pavement serves
for the horses of the Elector and the feet of
his subjects. The port, or beach, has the
appearance of something more business than
that of Andernach, being the resort of
passage-vessels between Mentz and Cologne;
but the broad quay, which has been raised
above it, is chiefly useful as a promenade
to the visitors of a close and gloomy town.
Beyond the terrace stands the Elector's palace,
an elegant and spacious stone edifice,
built to the height of three stories, and inclosing
a court, which is large enough to be
light as well as magnificent. The front towards
the Rhine is simple, yet grand, the
few ornaments being so well proportioned
to its size, as neither to debase it by minuteness,
nor encumber it by vastness. An entablature,
displaying some allegorical figures
in bas relief, is supported by six Doric columns,
which contribute much to the majestic
simplicity of the edifice. The palace
was built, about ten years since, by the
reigning Elector, who mentions, in an inscription,
his attention to the architectural
art; and a fountain, between the building
and the town, is inscribed with a few words,
which seem to acknowledge his subjects as
beings of the same species with himself;
<span class="smallcaps">Clemens Winceslaus Vicinis Suis</span>.</p>

<p>But the most striking parts of the view
from this quay are the rock and fortress of
Ehrenbreitstein, that present themselves immediately
before it, on the other side of the
river; notwithstanding the breadth of which
they appear, to rise almost perpendicularly
over Coblentz. At the base of the rock
stands a large building, formerly the palace
of the Electors, who chose to reside under
the immediate protection of the fortress,
rather than in the midst of their capital.
Adjoining it is the village of Ehrenbreitstein,
between which and Coblentz a flying
bridge is continually passing, and, with its
train of subordinate boats, forms a very
picturesque object from the quay. The
fortress itself consists of several tier of low
walls, built wherever there was a projection
in the rock capable of supporting them, or
wherever the rock could be hewn so as to
afford room for cannon and soldiers. The
stone, taken out of the mass, served for the
formation of the walls, which, in some
places, can scarcely be distinguished from
the living rock. Above these tier, which
are divided into several small parts, according
to the conveniences afforded by the
cliff, is built the castle, or citadel, covering
its summit, and surrounded by walls more
regularly continued, as well as higher.
Small towers, somewhat in the antient
form, defend the castle, which would be of
little value, except for its height, and for
the gradations of batteries between it and
the river. Thus protected, it seems impregnable
on that side, and is said to be not
much weaker on the other; so that the
garrison, if they should be willing to fire
upon Coblentz, might make it impossible
for an enemy to remain within it, except
under the cover of very high entrenchments.
This is the real defence of the
city, for its walls would presently fall before
heavy artillery; and this, it is believed,
might be preserved as long as the garrison
could be supplied with stores.</p>

<p>We crossed the river from the quay to
the fortress, by means of the very simple
invention, a flying bridge. That, by which
part of the passage of the Waal is made at
Nimeguen, has been already mentioned;
this is upon the same principle, but on a
much larger scale. After the barges, upon
which the platform is laid, are clear of the
bank, the whole passage is effected with no
other labour than that of the rudder. A
strong cable, which is fastened to an anchor
at each side of the river, is supported across
it by a series of small boats; the bridge has
two low masts, one on each barge, and
these are connected at the top by a beam,
over which the cable is passed, being confined
so as that it cannot slip beyond them.
When the bridge is launched, the rapidity
of the current forces it down the Rhine
as far as the cable will permit: having
reached that point, the force, received from
the current, gives it the only direction of
which it is capable, that across the river,
with the cable which holds it. The steersman
manages two rudders, by which he
assists in giving it this direction. The voyage
requires nine or ten minutes, and the
bridge is continually passing. The toll,
which, for a foot passenger, is something
less than a penny, is paid, for the benefit
of the Elector, at an office, on the bank,
and a sentinel always accompanies the
bridge, to support his government, during
the voyage.</p>

<p>The old palace of Ehrenbreitstein, deserted
because of its dampness, and from
the fear of its being overwhelmed by the
rock, that sometimes scatters its fragments
upon it, is now used as a barrack and
hospital for soldiers. It is a large building,
even more pleasantly situated than the new
one, being opposite to the entrance of the
Moselle into the Rhine; and its structure,
which has been once magnificent, denotes
scarcely any other decay, than all buildings
will shew, after a few years' neglect. The
rock has allowed little room for a garden,
but there are some ridiculous ornaments
upon a very narrow strip of ground, which
was probably intended for one.</p>

<p>The only entrance into the fortress, on
this side, is by a road, cut in the solid rock,
under four gateways. It is so steep, that
we were compelled to decline the honour
of admission, but ascended it far enough to
judge of the view, commanded from the
summit, and to be behind the batteries, of
which some were mounted with large brass
cannon. Coblentz lies beneath it, as open
to inspection as a model upon a table.
The sweeps of the Rhine and the meanders
of the Moselle, the one binding the plain,
the other intersecting it, lead the eye towards
distant hills, that encircle the capacious
level. The quay of the city, with
the palace and the moving bridge, form an
interesting picture immediately below, and
we were unwilling to leave the rock for the
dull and close streets of Coblentz. On our
return, the extreme nakedness of the new
palace, which is not sheltered by trees, on
any side, withdrew our attention from the
motley group of passengers, mingled with
hay carts and other carriages, on the flying
bridge.</p>

<p>The long residence of the emigrant
princes and noblesse of France in this city
is to be accounted for not by its general
accommodations, or gaieties, of which it is
nearly as deficient as the others of Germany;
but first by the great hospitality of
the Elector towards them, and then by the
convenience of its situation for receiving
intelligence from France, and for communicating
with other countries. The Elector
held frequent levies for the French nobility,
and continued for them part of the splendour
which they had enjoyed in their own
country. The readiness for lending money
upon property, or employments in France,
was also so great, that those, who had not
brought cash with them, were immediately
supplied, and those, who had, were encouraged
to continue their usual expences. We
know it from some of the best possible
authority, that, at the commencement of
the march towards Longwy, money, at
four per cent. was even pressed upon many,
and that large sums were refused.</p>

<p>Here, and in the neighbourhood, between
sixty and seventy squadrons of cavalry,
consisting chiefly of those who had formerly
enjoyed military, or other rank, were
formed; each person being mounted and
equipped chiefly at his own expence. We
heard several anecdotes of the confidence,
entertained in this army, of a speedy arrival
in Paris; but, as the persons, to whom they
relate, are now under the pressure of misfortune,
there would be as little pleasure as
propriety in repeating them.</p>

<p>At Coblentz, we quitted, for a time, the
left bank of the Rhine, in order to take the
watering place of Selters, in our way to
Mentz. Having crossed the river and ascended
a steep road, near the fortress, we
had fine glimpses of its walls, bastions and
out-towers, and the heathy knolls, around
them, with catches of distant country. The
way continued to lie through the dominions
of the Elector of Treves, which are here so
distinguished for their wretchedness as to be
named the <i>Siberia of Germany</i>! It is paved,
and called a <i>chauss&eacute;e</i>; but those, who have
not experienced its ruggedness, can have
no idea of it, except by supposing the pavement
of a street torn up by a plough, and
then suffered to fix itself, as it had fallen.
Always steep, either in ascent or descent, it
is not only the roughness, that prevents
your exceeding the usual post-pace of three
English miles an hour. Sometimes it runs
along edges of mountains, that might almost
be called precipices, and commands short
views of other mountains and of vallies
entirely covered with thick, but not lofty
forests; sometimes it buries itself in the
depths of such forests and glens; sometimes
the turrets of an old chateau peep above
these, but rather confirm than contradict
the notion of their desolateness, having been
evidently built for the purposes of the
chace; and sometimes a mud village surprises
you with a few inhabitants, emblems
of the misery and savageness of the country.</p>

<p>These are the mountains of Wetteravia,
the boundaries of many a former and far-seen
prospect, then picturesque, sublime, or
graceful, but now desolate, shaggy, and
almost hideous; as in life, that, which is so
grand as to charm at a distance, is often
found to be forlorn, disgustful and comfortless
by those, who approach it.</p>

<h3><a name="MONTABAUR" id="MONTABAUR">MONTABAUR.</a></h3>

<p>Six hours after leaving Coblentz, we
reached Montabaur, the first post-town on
the road, and distant about eighteen miles.
An ancient chateau, not strong enough to
be a castle, nor light enough to be a good
house, commands the town, and is probably
the residence of the lord. The walls and
gates shew the antiquity of Montabaur, but
the ruggedness of its site should seem to
prove, that there was no other place in the
neighbourhood, on which a town could be
built. Though it is situated in a valley, as
to the nearer mountains, it is constructed
chiefly on two sides of a narrow rock, the
abrupt summit of which is in the centre of
this very little place.</p>

<p>The appearance of Montabaur is adequate
in gloominess to that of several before
seen; but it would be endless to repeat, as
often as they should be true, the descriptions
of the squalidness and decay, that characterise
German towns; nor should we have
noticed these so often, if the negligence of
others, in this respect, had not left us to
form deceitful expectations, suitable to the
supposed importance of several very conspicuous,
but really very wretched cities.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="LIMBOURG" id="LIMBOURG">LIMBOURG.</a></h3>

<p>Over a succession of forest mountains,
similar to those just passed, we came,
in the afternoon, to Limbourg, another post-town,
or, perhaps, city, and another collection
of houses, like tombs, or forsaken hospitals.
At an inn, called the Three Kings,
we saw first the sullenness and then the ferocious
malignity of a German landlord
and his wife, exemplified much more fully
than had before occurred. When we afterwards
expressed our surprise, that the magistrates
should permit persons of such conduct
to keep an inn, especially where there
was only one, we learned, that this fellow
was himself the chief magistrate, or burgomaster
of the place; and his authority appeared
in the fearfulness of his neighbours
to afford any sort of refreshment to those,
who had left his inn. One of the Elector's
ministers, with whom we had the pleasure
to be acquainted, informed us, that he knew
this man, and that he must have been intoxicated,
for that, though civil when sober,
he was madly turbulent and abusive, if
otherwise. It appeared, therefore, that a
person was permitted to be a magistrate,
who, to the knowledge of government, was
exposed by his situation to be intoxicated,
and was outrageous, whenever he was so.
So little is the order of society estimated
here, when it is not connected with the
order of politics.</p>

<p>Near Limbourg, the forest scenery, which
had shut up the view, during the day, disappeared,
and the country lost, at least, an
uniformity of savageness. The hills continue,
but they are partly cultivated. At
a small distance from the town, a steep ascent
leads to a plain, on which a battle was
fought, during the short stay of the French
in this district, in the campaign of 1792.
Four thousand French were advancing towards
Limbourg; a small Prussian corps
drew up to oppose them, and the engagement,
though short, was vivid, for the
Prussians did not perceive the superiority of
the French in numbers, till the latter began
to spread upon the plain, for the purpose
of surrounding them. Being then compelled
to retreat, they left several of the
Elector's towns open to contribution, from
which five-and-twenty thousand florins were
demanded, but the remonstrances of the
magistrates reduced this sum to 8000 florins,
or about 700l. The French then entered
Limbourg, and extended themselves over
the neighbouring country. At Weilbourg,
the residence of a Prince of the House of
Nassau, they required 300,000 florins, or
25,000l. which the Prince neither had, nor
could collect, in two days, through his
whole country. All his plate, horses,
coaches, arms and six pieces of cannon,
were brought together, for the purpose of
removal; but afterwards two individuals
were accepted as hostages, instead of the
Prince himself, who had been at first demanded.
The action near Limbourg took
place on the 9th of November, and, before
the conclusion of the month, the French
had fallen back to Franckfort, upon the re-approach
of the Prussian and Austrian
troops.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="SELTERS" id="SELTERS">SELTERS.</a></h3>

<p>We had a curiosity to see this place,
which, under the name of Seltzer, is so
celebrated throughout Europe, for its medicinal
water. Though it is rather in the
high road to Franckfort than to Mentz,
there seemed no probability of inconvenience
in making this short departure from
our route, when it was to be joined again
from a place of such public access as Selters
appeared likely to be found.</p>

<p>About seven miles from Limbourg, a
descent commences, at the bottom of which
stands this village. What a reproof to the
expectation of comfort, or convenience in
Germany! Selters, a spot, to which a valetudinarian
might be directed, with the
prospect of his finding not only abundant
accommodation, but many luxuries, Selters
is literally and positively nothing more than
an assemblage of miserable cottages, with
one inn and two houses for officers of the
Elector, stuck in a dirty pass, which more
resembles a ditch than a road. The village
may be said to be near half a mile
long, because the huts, being mostly separated
from each other, continue as far;
and this length would increase its inconvenience
to invalids, if such should ever stay
there longer than to see it, for there is nothing
like a swept path-way, and the road,
in which they must walk, is probably always
deeply covered with mud, being so
when we were there in the beginning of
July. There was then, however, not one
stranger, besides ourselves, in the place, and
we found, that very rarely any aggravate the
miseries of sickness by a stay at Selters.</p>

<p>The only lodgings to be had are at the
inn, and fortunately for travellers this is
not such as might be expected from the appearance
of the village. Finding there the
novelty of an obliging host and hostess, we
were very well contented to have reached
it, at night, though we were to stay there
also the next day, being Sunday. The
rooms are as good as those in the inns of
German cities, and three, which are called
Court Chambers, having been used by the
Elector and lately by the King of Prussia,
are better. These are as open as the others
to strangers.</p>

<p>The spring is at the foot of one of several
hills, which immediately surround the village,
and is separated from the road by a
small court yard. An oaken covering, at
the height of ten or twelve feet, prevents
rain from falling into the wooden bason,
in which the stream rises; and two or
three of the Elector's guards watch over it,
that no considerable quantity may be taken,
without payment of the duty, which forms
a large part of his income. Many thousands
of stone bottles are piled round this
court, and, for the reputation of the spring,
care is taken to fill them as immediately as
possible, before their removal for exportation.</p>

<p>The policy of keeping this income intire
is said to be a motive for neglecting the
condition of the village. A duty could not
well be demanded of those, who should
drink at the spring, but is easily collected
before the water is bottled for removal; it
is, therefore, not wished, that there should
be many visitors, at Selters. We did not
hear this reason upon the spot, but it is
difficult otherwise to account for a negligence,
which prevents the inhabitants of
the neighbouring country from being
enriched at the expence of wanderers from
others.</p>

<p>Nor is it only a duty, but the whole profit
of the traffick, till the water leaves the
place, which rewards the care of the Elector.
His office for the sale of it is established
here, and his agents alone transmit it
into foreign countries. The business is sufficient
to employ several clerks, and the
number of bottles annually filled is so immense,
that, having omitted to write it
down, we will not venture to mention it
from memory. The water is brought to
table constantly and at an easy price in all
the towns near the Rhine. Mixed with
Rhenish wine and sugar it forms a delightful,
but not always a safe beverage, in hot
weather. The acid of the wine, expelling
the fixed air of other ingredients, occasions
an effervescence, like that of Champagne,
but the liquor has not a fourth part of the
obnoxious strength of the latter. The danger
of drinking it is, that the acid may be
too powerful for some constitutions.</p>

<p>After being surprised by the desolateness
of the village, we were not less so to find
amongst its few inhabitants one, whose
manners and information, so far from bearing
the character of the dreariness around
him, were worthy of the best society in the
most intelligent cities. This was the Commissary
and Privy Counsellor of the Elector
for the district, who, having heard, that
there were some English visitors at the well,
very frankly introduced himself to us by
his civilities, and favoured us with his company
in the afternoon. He had been in
England, with many valuable introductions,
and had formed from the talents and accomplishments
of a distinguished Marquis
an high opinion of the national character;
a circumstance, which probably united with
his natural disposition, in inducing him to
emulate towards us the general politeness of
that truly honourable person.</p>

<p>When we enquired how the journey of
the next day was to be performed, it appeared,
that no other carriage could be
hired in the place than a sort of one-horse
chair, which would take us to the next post
town, from whence we might proceed with
the usual chaises. The driver walked at
the side of this uncouth carriage, which had
shafts and wheels strong enough for a waggon;
and, either by the mistake or intention
of his master in directing him, we were
led, not to the post town, for a chaise, if it
could be had, but entirely through a forest
country to Mentz, by roads made only
for the woodcutters, and, as it afterwards
proved, known to few others, except to our
ingenious voiturier. We did not pass a
town, or village, at which it was possible to
change the carriage, and had, therefore, no
other alternative, when the mistake was discovered,
than to return to Selters, or to proceed
to Mentz, in this inconvenient and
ludicrous vehicle. We chose to proceed,
and had some reward for fatigue, by passing
nearly an whole day under the shade of
deep and delightful forests, little tamed by
the hand of man, and appearing to acknowledge
only "the season's difference."</p>

<p>Between Selters and these forests, the
country is well cultivated, and frequently
laid out in garden-fields, in which there
was the first appearance of cheerful labour
we had seen in Germany. After passing
a small town, on the summit of a hill to
the left, still surrounded by its antient fortifications,
we entered a large plain, skirted,
on one side, by villages; another town, at
the end of which, was almost the last sign
of an inhabited country, that appeared for
several hours. The forest then commenced,
and, with the exception of one hamlet,
enveloped near the middle, we saw nothing
but lofty oaks, elms and chesnuts, till we
emerged from it in the afternoon, and came
to a town of the Landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt.
Roebucks are said to be numerous,
and wild boars not very scarce, in this forest;
but we saw none either here, or in
those near Limbourg, which are much inferior
to this in beauty. Upon the whole,
it was a scene of perfect novelty; without
which it now seems that we should have
wanted many ideas of sylvan life and much
of the delight, excited by Shakespeare's exquisite
description of it.</p>

<p>The country afterwards opens towards</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="MENTZ" id="MENTZ">MENTZ,</a></h3>

<p>Which stands in a spacious plain,
on the opposite edge of the Rhine, and is
visible, at a considerable distance, with its
massy towers and numerous spires. Within
two or three miles of the city, the symptoms
of ruin, occasioned by the siege in 1793,
began to appear. A village, on the left,
had scarcely one house entire; and the
tower of the church was a mere wreck,
blackened by flames, and with large chasms,
that admitted the light. The road did not
pass nearer to it than two miles, but the
broken walls and roofs were distinguishable
even at that distance, and sometimes a part,
which had been repaired, contrasted its colour
with the black and smoky hues of the
remainder. This was the village of Kostheim,
so often contended for in the course
of the siege, being on the opposite bank of
the Rhine to the city, and capable of obstructing
the intercourse with it by water.</p>

<p>The country on the eastern side of the
river was otherwise but little damaged, if
we except the destruction of numerous orchards;
for the allies were not strong
enough to besiege the city on all sides at
once, and contented themselves with occupying
some posts in this quarter, capable of
holding the garrison of Cassel in awe.</p>

<p>This Cassel is a small village exactly opposite
to Mentz, and communicating with
it by a bridge of boats. It was unfortified
before the invasion of the French; but these
had no sooner entered the city, than they
perceived the importance of such a place,
and prepared themselves to render it a regular
fortress. In about two months they
completely surrounded it with earthen
works and outworks, ditched and pallisadoed.
Some of the nearest orchards were
cut down to be used in these fortifications.
The fruit trees still remain with their
branches upwards from the ditch, and serve
instead of <i>chevaux de frise</i>.</p>

<p>The village of Hockheim, which is also
on this side of the Rhine, is further to the
left than Kostheim, and remains uninjured,
at the top of the round and easy hill, the
vines of which are so much celebrated for
their flavour, as to give a name to great
quantities of wine, produced in other districts.
After the siege, the merchants of
the neighbourhood enhanced the price of
their stocks by reporting, that all the vineyards
had been destroyed; but the truth is,
that Hockheim was not much contended
for, and that little damage was done even
to the crops then in bloom. The village is
advantageously situated about the confluence
of the Rhine and the Maine, and, if it had
been nearer the city, would probably have
been so important, as to have been contested,
till it was destroyed.</p>

<p>This is the home ground of the scene,
which spreads before the traveller, who approaches
Mentz from the eastern shore of
the Rhine. Furthest to the left is Hockheim,
then the devastated village of Kostheim,
then the fortifications of Cassel,
which, with the river, are between him and
the city. Beyond, the horizon is bounded
on all sides by gradual hills, distant and
apparently fruitful; but those to the north
are pre-eminent, with gentle slopes at their
feet, coloured sweetly by corn, dark wood
and gleams of reddish earth.</p>

<p>The works of Cassel render the approach
to the city very tedious, for they have been
so contrived as that the road nearly follows
them, in all their angles, for the purpose of
being commanded by many points at once.
The village was now garrisoned by Prussians,
of whom, some were lying under the
sheds of their guard-house near the bridge,
and others were riding over it, with just
speed enough to give one an idea of military
earnestness. Their horses shook the
floor of the bridge of boats, which here
crosses the Rhine, at its breadth of nearly
eight hundred feet, and disturbed the promenade,
for which it is usually frequented
in an evening. We followed them, admiring
the expanse, and rapidity of the
river more than the appearance of the city,
where gloominess is too much mingled
with grandeur; till, at the end of the
bridge, we were stopped at another guard-house,
to answer the usual enquiries. A
soldier accompanied us thence to a large
square filled with cannon and mortars,
where the captain of the guard examined
our passport. We were then very glad to
pass the evening at an inn without further
researches; but there were some symptoms
of the late condition of the city to attract
attention in the way.</p>

<p>The Elector's palace, which forms one
side of this square, having been converted
into an hospital by the French, is still used
as such, or as a barrack, by the Prussians;
and the windows were crowded with the
figures of half-dressed soldiers. Many of
the cannon in the square remained with
the fractures, made by the balls of the besiegers.
This place communicates with a
broad street, in which were many buildings,
filled with soldiers, and an handsome house,
that, having belonged to one of the Clubbists,
was destroyed immediately after the
expulsion of the French. The walls still
remain bare and open. Some greater ruins,
occasioned by fire, during the siege, were
visible at a distance; and, upon the whole,
we had interest enough excited, as to the
immediate history of the place, to take little
notice of the narrow and difficult passages,
through which we wound for half an hour,
after leaving the principal street.</p>

<p>The next morning, the friends, to whom
we had letters, began to conduct us through
the melancholy curiosities, left in the city
by the siege. These are chiefly in the
southern quarter, against which the direct
attack of the allies was made, and their
approaches most advanced. Some entire
streets have been destroyed here, and were
still in ruins. A magnificent church, attached
to a convent of Franciscan monks, is
among the most lamentable spectacles; what
was the roof now lies in heaps over the
pavement; not a vestige of furniture, or
decoration, has escaped the flames, and there
are chasms in the walls larger than the noble
windows, that once illuminated them.
This church and convent were set on fire
by a bomb; and of the sick soldiers, who
were lodged in the latter, it is feared that
but few were removed before the destruction
of the building. We next saw the remains
of a palace, built by the present
Provost of the Chapter of Nobles; an institution,
which is so rich, that their Superior
had a more elegant residence than the
Elector. It was of stone, and the principal
front was in the Corinthian order, six columns
of which supported a spacious open
gallery, ornamented with statues, for its
whole length. The wings formed two
sides of a square, which separated the palace
from the street. A profusion of the richest
furniture and a valuable collection of paintings
filled the interior. Of the whole edifice
little now remains but the shattered
walls of the centre, which have been so
scorched as to lose all appearance of having
belonged to a splendid structure. It was
burnt the night before the fire of the Franciscan
church, and two nights after the
French had removed their head quarters
and their municipality from it. On the day
before the removal, a bomb had fallen upon
the French General Blou, destroying him
on the spot, and mortally wounding an
officer, with whom he was conversing.
The ruins are now so accumulated over the
court-yard, that we could not discern it to
have ever had that appendage of a distinguished
residence.</p>

<p>But the church of Notre Dame was the
most conspicuous of many ruined objects.
The steeple of this had been one of the
grandest ornaments of the city; a shower
of bombs set fire to it; and, while it was
thus rendered an easy mark for the besiegers,
their cannon played upon and beat
a great part of it to the ground. By its fall
the roof of the church was shattered, but
the body did not otherwise suffer any material
injury. Wooden galleries have been
raised round the remainder of the steeple,
not for the purpose of repairing, but for
that of entirely removing it; and, to save
the trouble of letting down the stones on
the outside, a wooden pipe, or channel has
been made, through which they are lowered
into the church. The appearance of this
steeple, which was once very large and
lofty, is rendered striking by these preparations
for its total destruction.</p>

<p>The whole church is built of a stone, dug
from the neighbouring hills, the colour of
which is so delicate a pink, that it might be
supposed to be given by art. The Elector's
palace and several other public buildings in
the city are formed of this stone.</p>

<p>Passing through the gates on this side of
Mentz, we came to a slope near the river,
and beyond the glacis of the place, which
was then partly covered with huge masses
of stone scattered among the roots of broken
trees and shrubs, that had begun again to
shoot their verdure over the amputated
trunks. This was the site of a palace of
the Elector, called, both from the beauty
of its situation, and the splendour of its
structure, La Favorita. The apartments of
the palace and the terraces of the garden
commanded extensive views of the Rhine
and the surrounding country ascending from
its banks; and the gardens themselves were
so beautifully disposed as to be thought
worthy of the name of English. They
were ornamented with pavilions, which had
each its distinct prospect, and with one
music room in the thickest part of the
shrubbery. Of the building nothing is now
visible but some disjointed stones; and of
the garden, only the broken trunks of trees.
The palace was burned and the gardens
levelled by the French, that they might not
afford shelter to the Prussians, during the
siege.</p>

<p>From this spot we were shewn the positions
of the allied forces, the course of their
approaches and the chief outworks of the
city. Hockheim, Kostheim and Cassel lay
before us, on the other side of the river;
a gentle rise on this side, at the distance of
nearly a mile, was the first station of the
allies, part of whose force was covered behind
it; their last batteries were within two
hundred and fifty paces of the city. The
ground had been since levelled, and was
now covered with standing corn, but the
track of the trenches was, in some places,
visible. On the other hand, the forts, in
which the strength of the whole so much
consists, were completely repaired, and had
no appearance of having been so lately attacked.
They are five in number, and,
being raised at a considerable distance from
the walls of the city, no near approaches
can be made, till some of them are either
taken, or destroyed; for they are said to be
regular and strong fortifications, capable of
containing numerous garrisons, and communicating
with the city itself by passages,
cut in the ground, through which they
may be constantly reinforced.</p>

<p>Only one of these five forts, that nearest
to the river, was destroyed in the late siege,
which would have been much more tedious,
but for the want of provisions and medicines,
that began to be felt in the garrison.
The walls of the city were almost uninjured,
so that it has not been thought necessary
to repair them in the few places,
where balls may be perceived to have
struck. The bombardment was the chief
annoyance of the garrison, who were not
sheltered in caserns, and whose magazines,
both of ammunition and provision, were
frequently destroyed by it. Their numbers
were also greatly reduced by sallies and by
engagements, on the other side of the
Rhine, in defence of Cassel, or in attack of
part of an island, called the Bleiau.</p>

<p>We walked round the city upon what is
termed the <i>glacis</i>, that is upon the slope,
which ascends from the plain towards the
top of the ditch, and which is the furthest
of the defensive works, being very gradually
raised, that those, who are upon it, may
be exposed, at every step, to the fire from
the walls. The forts, which are formed
of solid earthen works, covered with turf,
would scarcely attract the notice of an unmilitary
eye, if the channelled passages to
them did not issue from this slope, and if
the sentinels, stalking upon the parapets, did
not seem of a gigantic size, by having their
whole figures raised against the light.</p>

<p>Mentz was at this time the dep&ocirc;t of
stores for the Prussian army on the Rhine,
and there were persons employed upon the
<i>glacis</i>, in counting heaps of cannon balls,
which had been delivered from some neighbouring
foundery. On the bank of the
river, others were throwing waggon-loads
of hay into large barges, on which it was
piled to such an height, that small passages
were cut through it for the rowers to work
in. There were nine or ten barges so
filled; and in these labours more activity
was apparent than in any other transactions
we saw at Mentz.</p>

<p>Having passed round the city, between
the walls and the forts, which protect them,
to the north, west and south, we came, at
this latter side, to some other signals of a
theatre of war. Here had been a noble
alley of at least a mile and a half long,
formed of poplars as large and high as elms,
and surrounded, on each side, by plantations,
intersected by small and irregular
walks. Being led along the banks of the
Rhine, this alley, with its adjoining groves,
afforded a most delightful promenade, and
was classed amongst the best ornaments,
given to the river, in its whole course.
This also was destroyed upon the approach
of the besiegers, that it might not afford
them shelter. The trunks of the sturdy
trees, cut at the height of one or two feet
from the ground, shew, by their solidity
and the abundance of their vigorous shoots,
how long they might have flourished, but
for this disaster.</p>

<p>An Englishman, walking amidst the ensigns
of such artificial and premature desolation,
cannot help considering the natural
security of his country, and rejoicing, that,
even if the strong and plain policy of
neglecting all foreign consequence, and avoiding
all foreign interests, except the commercial
ones, which may be maintained by
a navy, should for ever be rejected, still his
home cannot be invaded; and, though the
expence of wars should make poverty general,
the immediate horrors of them cannot
enter the cities, or the cottages of an
island.</p>

<p>Great part of our time at Mentz was
occupied by enquiries concerning the siege,
which was not so much a topic as we had
expected to find it. We probably heard,
however, all that was to be told, and had a
German pamphlet recommended, containing
the history of the place from the first
invasion of the French to their departure.
The authenticity of this was assured to us;
and it is partly from it, partly from the accounts
given by our friends, that the following
short narrative has been extracted.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="X-OF_MENTZ_IN_1792_AND_1793" id="X-OF_MENTZ_IN_1792_AND_1793">OF MENTZ IN 1792 AND 1793.</a></h3>

<p>The entrance of a French army into
Worms, in the beginning of October 1792,
had excited a considerable alarm in Mentz,
before the inhabitants of the latter city received
the accounts, which were not long
wanting, of express and avowed preparations
for a march towards them. Great
numbers of French emigrants had been
drawn to the city by the meeting of the
Emperor and the King of Prussia there, a
few months before; many had arrived since
the dissolution of their army in Champagne;
and, during the approach of the
Republican troops to Spires and Worms,
families were continually passing through
the city, joining those, who began to take
their flight from it. The narrow streets
were filled with carriages, and the distressful
haste of the travellers served to depress
the spirits of the inhabitants, who saw how
little their city was thought capable of defence.
On the 15th of October, Baron
d'Albini, a counsellor of the Court, called
the Burgesses together, and admonished
them to make preparations for their security;
he also enquired, whether they thought
it prudent, that the Elector should remain
in the city with them? and, it being readily
answered, that they did not, the Elector set
out for Wurtzburg, a town about 100 miles
distant, and was followed by the members
of the government. At the same time, a
considerable emigration of the other inhabitants
took place.</p>

<p>The approach of the French had been so
little foreseen, till within the few last weeks,
that the garrison did not amount to a tenth
part of the war complement. The inhabitants,
however, having happily had little
experience of sieges, did not know what this
complement should be, and, after the first
alarm, began to think the deficiency might
be easily remedied. The Electoral troops,
having sent some useless detachments to
Spires, amounted to only 968 men, to
whom an hundred were added, obtained
from Nassau, Oranien, Weilburg, Bieberich
and Fuld by the Elector's demands of assistance
from his neighbours. Two hundred
and seven Austrian hussars of Esterhazy had
also arrived, on the 13th, and all the inhabitants
of the Rheingau, a populous district,
bordering upon the Rhine, were summoned
to the assistance of the capital. The
antient society of Archers of the city laid
down their bows for musquets; the Academicians
formed themselves into a corps,
and were placed, together with the Archers,
at several outposts. The traders, though
exempt from personal service, and unwilling
to surrender that privilege, resolved to
pay double watch-money for substitutes.
It began to be thought, that the threatened
progress of the French had been untruly
reported; that the siege could not be commenced
at that late season of the year; and
lastly, that some promised reinforcements of
Austrian troops could not be far off.</p>

<p>But, on the 19th of October, the French,
in four columns, began to surround the place.
They wore, at first, white cockades, expecting
to be mistaken for the army of M. de
Cond&eacute;; they were, however, known, and
fired upon. Though some days had been
passed in preparation, it was now found,
that there was little readiness for defence.
The best artillerymen had been lost at
Spires; there were, at first, no horses to
draw the cannon, so that oxen were used
for that purpose; the nearest balls to the
batteries of twenty-four pound cannon were
cast for twelve-pounders; and many of the
musquet cartridges could not be fired. In
a few hours, however, several of the artisans
applied themselves to the making of
cartridges; horses were supplied by the servants
of the Court and the Nobility, and all
hands were, in some way or other, employed.
It was then reported, that a corps
of Austrian troops was in the neighbourhood,
and, on the 19th, 1800 men entered
the city. These were recruits without ammunition,
and, for the most part, without
arms, being on their march to join the
army of the Emperor. They were then
under the command of two or three subalterns;
but some other Imperial officers
came in from the neighbourhood, and arms
were obtained from the Elector's arsenal.
After this reinforcement there were probably
about four thousand men in arms in
the city.</p>

<p>With this force, it is allowed, that a
much longer defence than was made might
have been expected; and, unless there was
some failure of the commander's attention,
the treachery of an engineer, to whom the
surrender is imputed, could certainly not
have been so effectual. <span class="smallcaps">Eikenmayer</span>, this
engineer, had, it seems, made known to the
French the commander's preparations for
defence; intelligence, which, if the preparations
had been greater, could have been
but little serviceable to the assailants. His
chief assistance was afforded to them by
much more conspicuous means; for, as the
inhabitants went frequently to a building
called St. Stephen's Tower, to observe the
progress of the besiegers, he assured them,
that the army, which really amounted only
to eleven thousand men, consisted of forty
thousand; that they had with them two-and-twenty
waggons, laden with scaling
ladders, and that the city would presently
be taken by storm. The same representations
of the besiegers' force were also made
by him to the Council of War; and these,
it is said, determined them to the surrender,
before the French had raised a battery
against the works.</p>

<p>Many of the citizens, however, were surprised
and enraged at this resolution; and
the captain of the Austrian reinforcements
expressed his displeasure, at the Council
House, where he declared, that he would
continue to defend the place, even without
permission. In the mean time, the capitulation
was signed, and he was induced to
submit to it by the solicitations even of the
citizens, by whom it was blamed, and by
their representations, that, in the present
agitated temper of the inhabitants, all attempts
at defence must be useless.</p>

<p>Baron d'<span class="smallcaps">Albini</span> carried news of the surrender
to the Elector, at Wurtzburg, and,
about five o'clock, on the 21st of October,
two French officers came to the Council
House, followed by two companies of grenadiers.
On the 22d, eight thousand French
entered the city, the other three thousand
having marched, the preceding day, to
Franckfort; the inhabitants, astonished to
find themselves taken by so small a force,
now saw, to their still greater surprise, that
their conquerors had scarcely any heavy
cannon. This day was passed in assigning
quarters to the troops, and, on the next,
Custine, the commander of the French,
called the members of the City Council together,
to whom, in a short speech, he promised
the protection of persons and properties,
inviting them, at the same time, to
promote the fraternization of the inhabitants
with the French nation. Professor
<span class="smallcaps">Bohmer</span>, who had accepted the office of
his Secretary, translated this address into
German, and it was circulated through the
city.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the French had no
sooner taken possession of this sudden prize,
than they began to foresee the probability
of being reduced to defensive measures, and
to prepare for them. They immediately
collected contributions of forage and corn
from the neighbouring villages; the streets
were rendered almost impassable by the
loads brought in; and, as the magazines
were soon filled, great quantities were wasted
by being exposed to the rain in gardens,
and trodden under the feet of horses in the
streets. The garrison was soon increased
to 20,000 men, of whom sometimes three
hundred sometimes five hundred were
lodged in each convent. The French soldiery
having committed some excesses,
Custine reproved their licentiousness, and
began to habituate them to discipline by
ordering a retirement to their quarters, at
certain hours, by beat of drum.</p>

<p>The inhabitants soon began to suspect
the contrivance and the persons, that had
produced the surrender; for Eikenmayer
lived in intimacy with Custine; Professor
Metternich, of the Academy of Mentz,
mounted the French cockade; and the
Elector's physician, having left the city,
upon a promise of assisting some peasants,
whom he asserted to be seized with an infectious
fever, had carried on a correspondence
with the French, as had <span class="smallcaps">Patoki</span>, a
merchant, born at Colmar, who had lately
received the right of citizenship.</p>

<p>The palaces of the Elector and the Provost
were now ransacked; and, though it
had been published as a rule, that the property
of private individuals should not be
touched, the houses of the nobility were
treated, as if they had belonged to the
Prince. The profligacy and pride of Custine
became every day more conspicuous,
and were oppressive upon the garrison, as
well as the inhabitants, though in a less degree.
Johannesberg, a village upon the
Rhine, at the distance of a few miles, is
celebrated for its wines, which sell for
three times the price of those of Hockheim.
Custine sent a part of the garrison solely to
bring him the wines from the cellars of
the Prince of Fuld, who has a palace there;
but, a compromise being proposed, the
negotiation was protracted so long, that a
Prussian corps, for which the Prince had
sent, carried Johannesberg, before the terms
were concluded. The Prince saved his
money, and lost only eighteen barrels of
wine, of which part was sent to Paris, and
the rest supplied the entertainments given
by Custine.</p>

<p>Those of the Germans, who attached
themselves to Custine, supplied him with information
of the state of the whole country.
His Secretary, Professor Bohmer, had begun
the institution of a Club so early as
the 22d of October; but this society is
thought to have become inconvenient, and
they soon after began to prepare for a National
Convention in Mentz.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Cassel was surveyed,
and the fortifications, for which Eikenmayer
is said to have furnished the design,
were commenced. The neighbouring peasants
were summoned to work at these, at
the price of fifteen French sous, or about
seven pence halfpenny a day; and intrenchments
were thrown round Kostheim.</p>

<p>On the 17th of December, Custine published
a proclamation, in which he stated,
that, whereas some persons had supposed
the King of Prussia to have so little respect
for his character as to have invited him to
a surrender, none should presume, on pain
of death, to speak of such a measure, in
future. This proclamation gave the inhabitants
of Mentz information, that the Prussians
were approaching. Some German
troops had, indeed, begun by degrees to
occupy the ground about Coblentz, but in
a condition, which did not promise active
measures, being weakened by a long march
and by sickness; the Hessians posted themselves
between Hanau and Franckfort; and
the Prussians advanced so near to the latter
city, that the scattered parties of the French
retired to, and at length lost it.</p>

<p>About this time, an Electoral Professor of
Philosophy and a Canon of Mentz, named
Dorsel, who had left his posts, in the preceding
year, to be naturalized, at Strasbourg,
returned with a design for an union
of Spires, Worms and Mentz into one territory,
under the protection of the French.
He procured the substitution of a Municipality
for the City Council. He obtained
considerable influence in the city; and, on
the 1st of January 1793, when the three
Commissioners of the Convention, Reubell,
Merlin and Haussman, entered Mentz, and
were received by Custine with military
honours, they shewed more attention to
the Professor than to the General.</p>

<p>The Prussian head quarters had been
established within a short distance of Mentz;
but, during all December, there had been
only affairs of advanced posts, so that some
tranquillity prevailed in the city. On the
6th of January, Hockheim was assailed by
six thousand Prussians; the French, however,
had been informed of the preparations
for attack, and had time to retire to Kostheim
and Cassel, leaving 112 prisoners and
twelve pieces of cannon. Some French,
who had concealed themselves in the church
tower, were thrown headlong from it, for
having shouted, or thrown stones at the
King of Prussia, as he passed.</p>

<p>After this, another month passed, without
hostile attempts on either side. The
Prussian troops were refreshed by rest; the
French passed the same time, partly in balls,
to which all the ladies of Mentz were invited,
and partly in preparations for defence.
On the 17th of January, a small
tree of liberty, which had been planted in
November, was removed, and a fir, seventy
feet high, placed in its stead, with much
ceremony. All the inhabitants were pressingly
invited, upon this occasion; Messrs.
Reubell, Merlin, Haussman and Custine
attended; the Mayor, Municipality, and
the Members of the Clubs followed; the
ensigns of the former government were
burned; Custine called upon the music of
the garrison for French airs, which occupied
the rest of the day; and the evening
concluded with entertainments and dancing.
Soon after, the Commissioners left the city,
and proceeded on a journey to the Moselle.</p>

<p>On the 16th of February, Custine published
a proclamation, and two new Commissioners,
who had just arrived, issued
another, founded upon a decree of the
French Convention, relative to the union
of other countries with France. The Council
House was full from morning till night;
the assembled traders declared their
adherence to the Germanic system; and the
new Commissioners seemed inclined to listen
to their remonstrances. But, when the three
former Commissioners returned, they treated
the Deputies of the trades with great
haughtiness, and refused them permission to
send agents to Paris. A second deputation,
on the 22d of February, was no better received,
and they were informed, that the
24th was the day for the commencement
of the new form. The traders are described
to have been much affected, at the return
of their Deputies. On the 23d of
February, early in the morning, the author
of a remonstrance, which had been presented,
was arrested and carried into banishment,
being accompanied by guards to the
advanced posts of the Prussians, at Hockheim.</p>

<p>The inhabitants now began to leave the
city by passports, which were, however, not
easily procured, or used. A proclamation
by the Municipality divided Mentz into
sections, and directed the manner, in which
each section should elect a representative,
on the 24th. On that day, the streets were
unusually silent, all the former burgesses
having resolved to remain in their houses,
except one, and only 266 persons met to
take the new oath and to make the new
elections. On the 25th, another proclamation
came out, and several banishments succeeded;
but the burgesses still adhered to
their resolution. The Municipality, on the
1st of March, again invited them to take
the new oaths, and gave notice of an order
of the Commissioners to the Mayor, to
publish a list of the sworn and unsworn, on
the Monday or Tuesday following. Notwithstanding
this, the number of sworn did
not equal 350.</p>

<p>Some of the neighbouring villages, which
were visited by the French Commissioners,
accepted their terms; the greater part refused
them.</p>

<p>At Worms, where clubs, similar to those
at Mentz, had been formed, 1051 persons
took the oaths. The inhabitants of Bingen
refused them.</p>

<p>In the mean time, some expeditions were
made into the Palatinate, and corn, to the
amount of sixty thousand florins, was taken
away, before the reiterated remonstrances of
the Palatine Resident at Mentz, upon the
subject of his master's neutrality, could restrain
them. In the first days of February,
the French had also entered Deux Ponts,
where the Duke relied so much upon his
having supplied only his contingent to the
treasure of the Empire, that he had not
left his palace, though he knew of their approaches
to his country. On the 9th, at
eleven at night, the Duke and Duchess fled,
with the utmost precipitation, to Manheim,
having left the palace only one hour before
the French entered it. Great quantities of
forage were swept away from this country,
and brought to Mentz, which the allies
now approached so nearly, that the garrison
hastily completed the fortifications of Cassel,
and filled the magazines with stores, lest
the communication should be cut off by the
destruction of the bridge.</p>

<p>On the 15th of February, they had begun
to destroy the palace of <i>La Favorita</i>,
and to erect a battery upon its ruins.
Though the carriage of provisions now occupied
so much of their attention, a great
number of large and small cannon were
brought from Landau; fresh troops arrived,
and General Wimpfen, who had defended
Thionville against the King of Prussia, was
declared the first in command. By banishments
and emigration, the number of persons
in the city was reduced fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>The new National Assembly met in
Mentz, on the 10th of March, that city
having chosen six deputies, Spires two,
Worms two, and some other places one
each. On the 17th, they had their first
sitting, and, on the 18th, declared all the
country between Landau and Bingen, which
places were then the limits of the French
posts near the Rhine, united in one independent
state. On the 19th, was agitated
the great question relative to the connections
of this state, and it was not till the
21st, that they declared their incorporation
with the French. Three deputies, <span class="smallcaps">Forster</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Patoki</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Lucks</span> were appointed,
the next day, to carry this resolution to
Paris; and several decrees, relative to the
interior administration of this state, were
passed, in consequence of which many persons
were conducted over the bridge into
banishment, on the 30th.</p>

<p>Accounts now arrived, that the siege
would shortly commence, and orders were
issued, relative to the prevention of fires, to
the collection of stores of provisions by
each family, and to several other domestic
particulars. All the inhabitants, those especially
in the neighbourhood of the granaries,
were directed to preserve large quantities
of water; and the proprietors of gardens
within the city were ordered to plant
them with herbs. Officers were sent round
to examine these gardens. Already each
family had been admonished to provide
subsistence for seven months; and the richer
class were now directed to furnish a loan
to the burgesses, that the latter might be
enabled to provide for the poor. In consequence
of this order, 38,646 florins 10
creitzers, or about 3200l. were collected,
and expended for provisions. The gardens
and walks round the city were now dismantled
of their trees, of which those in
the <i>Rheinallee</i>, before mentioned, were an
hundred years old. All the summer-houses
and villas, within cannon shot of the city,
were destroyed.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, the French garrison
in the fortress of Konigstein, which the
Prussians had blockaded for some months,
surrendered. In this month also other advances
were made towards Mentz. The
Prussian General Schonfield brought 12,000
men into the neighbourhood of Hockheim,
near which the Saxons were posted; the
King of Prussia, his son and the Duke of
Brunswick, who had passed part of the
winter at Franckfort, left it, on the 23d
of March; a bridge was laid, at St. Goar,
over which numerous bodies of Prussian
troops passed the Rhine; the French fell
back towards Bingen, and the Prussians occupied
a hill, not far from it. On the 28th,
they were closer pressed, and left all the
villages in the neighbourhood of Bingen,
from which place they were driven, the
next day, by a bombardment.</p>

<p>At the same time, a similar retreat towards
Mentz also took place from the
southward. At Worms, during the abandonment,
great quantities of hay and straw
were burned, and the burgesses kept watch,
all night, dreading the conflagration of the
whole city by the flames, rising from the
magazines. Immense masses of hay and
straw were also burned at Frankenthal,
where there had been a garrison, during the
whole winter; but the corn was carried
away. At Spires, early on the 31st of
March, the burgesses and troops were employed
in throwing the hay and straw from
the magazines into the ditch; but it appeared
that even this mode would not be
expeditious enough, and fire was at length
set to the whole store at once.</p>

<p>In the retreat from Oppenheim, though
the French were under considerable difficulties,
they were upon the point of obtaining
what they would have thought an abundant
reward for them. It was on the 30th of
March, that their cavalry and flying artillery
took the road by Alsheim. As this
was a place capable of making some defence,
and there were Prussian troops visible
at the gates, they began the attack by planting
cannon, and directing a vigorous fire
upon it. The King of Prussia, who was at
dinner in the town, and had not an hundred
men with him, received his first intelligence
of their approach from this fire.
He immediately rode out, on the opposite
side, and, sending some hussars to the spot,
the French did not continue the contest,
but made their retreat by another road.
If they had known how few troops were in
the town, they would, of course, have
entered it without commencing this fire;
and the Prussian officers agree, that, if they
had done so, there would have been little
chance of saving their monarch. Had they
been aware also, that his Prussian Majesty
was there, they might have reduced this
slight chance to an impossibility; for they
were sufficiently numerous to have surrounded
the town, and had approached so
quietly, that they were not known to be
near it. The Prussians had no cannon, and
the French were otherwise greatly superior;
though, having no other purpose for entering
the town, than to continue their retreat,
they did not wait to contest it, but
retired by another road. That a circumstance,
which would have had such an effect
upon the affairs of Europe, should have depended
upon so slight a chance as this, we
could not have believed, if the story had
not been confirmed to us by ample authority.</p>

<p>The garrison of Mentz was increased by
these retreats to 23,000 men; General
Kalkreuth, who commanded the blockade from
Laubenheim to Budenheim, a distance of
twelve miles, had only 16,000 men. General
Schonfield, with his corps of observation,
was at Hockheim. The besiegers,
however, presently amounted to 30,000
men. It is remarkable, that, though the
French retreated from several quarters, at
once, and in many small columns, not one
of these was effectually interrupted by the
Prussian commander.</p>

<p>Upon intelligence of these advances, the
Elector of Mentz paid a visit to the King
of Prussia, at his head quarters, and left
his minister, the Baron d'<span class="smallcaps">Albini</span>, to attend
to the affairs of the recovered places.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April, the blockade
was more closely pressed, and the preparations
for the siege seriously commenced.
General d'<span class="smallcaps">Oyr&eacute;</span> was made commander in
the city, with a Council of sixteen persons,
to assist him in restoring the means of its
defence. A person was placed at the top
of an high building, called Stephen's
Tower, with glasses, which enabled him to
overlook the country for nine miles round.
He had a secretary with him, that his
view might never be unnecessarily diverted,
and was obliged to make a daily report of
his observations. The beating of drums
and ringing of bells were forbidden throughout
the whole city, that the besiegers might
not know in what quarters the corps de
garde were placed, or what churches were
left without the military. All prospect
houses and trees within the walls, which
could serve as marks to the fire without,
were ordered to be demolished. Many
days were passed in bringing further stores
of provisions into the city; after which an
account of the stock was taken, and there
were found to be</p>

<table summary="stock">
<tr><td align="right">24,090</td><td align="left">sacks of wheat.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1,465</td><td align="left">of other corn.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">996</td><td align="left">of mixed grain.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Of which 26,551 sacks, it was stated, that
23,070 sacks of meal could be made. To
this was to be added in sifted meal of
wheat 109 sacks, of other corn 45 sacks,
of mixed grain 10,076 sacks; making in
all 33,300 sacks of meal. There were
besides</p>

<table summary="stores">
<tr><td align="right">43,960</td><td align="left">rations of biscuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">7,275</td><td align="left"> of rice.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">13,045</td><td align="left">of dried herbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Of forage, 10,820</td><td align="left">quintals of hay.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">1,518</td><td align="left">sacks of oats.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2,503</td><td align="left">of barley.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Council estimated, that the garrison
had corn enough for nine months, rice for
seven, and herbs for six. There were fifteen
hundred horses, and it was reckoned,
that the straw was enough for ten months,
the oats for four-and-twenty days, and the
barley for eighty days. The garrison was
numbered, and found to consist of 22,653
persons; of whom to each soldier was allotted,
for the future, 24 ounces of bread,
per day, in lieu of 28, and 4 ounces of
fresh meat, or 3 ounces of salt, in lieu of
8 ounces of fresh. The allowance of the
sick in the hospitals was changed from
twelve to eight ounces.</p>

<p>During these preparations for a long
siege, the diminution of the number of inhabitants,
by means of the clubs, was pursued.
On the 8th of April, all persons, not
useful to the army, were ordered to leave
the city, unless they would take the new
oath; at the same time, it was said, that on
account of the foreseen want of money,
the soldiers, employed on the works, would
be no longer paid, but the other workmen
would continue to receive their salaries.</p>

<p>The garrison made their first sortie, on
the night of the 10th and 11th, proceeding
towards the Rhine. Kostheim was immediately
taken, and the attack upon the Hessians
succeeded, at first, but a reinforcement
compelled the French to retire. About this
time, the Commissioner Reubell went to
Oppenheim, where he delivered a proposal
for peace to the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>The village of Weissenau was contended
for, on the 15th, 16th and 17th, and finally
destroyed, the French soldiers, who remained
upon the spot, subscribing 460 livres for
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the 18th, nearly the whole of a
French convoy of 90 waggons was taken
by the Prussians. On the 20th the Imperialists
erected a small fort on a point of
land, near the Main, and the French, on
the other hand, perfected a battery, at Kostheim,
with which they set on fire some
stables.</p>

<p>The price of provisions was already so
much increased in the city, that salt butter
cost 48 creitzers, or 16d. pence per pound.</p>

<p>In the night of the 28th and 29th, the
French landed in three vessels, and destroyed
a battery, erected near the Main.
On the 1st of May, at one in the morning,
they attacked the Prussians, at Hockheim,
and set the village of Kostheim on fire.
The Prussians repulsed them with loss, but
they remained in Kostheim, notwithstanding
the fire, which continued for three
days; they were then expelled by the
Prussians, but soon returned with reinforcements,
and a sanguinary contest commenced,
at the end of which they continued
to be masters of the village. A numerous
garrison was placed in it, which, on the
8th, was again attacked by the Prussians,
but without effect. Thus the greatest part
of May was spent in contests for villages
and posts, in which the French were
generally the assailants. In the night of the
30th, they beat up, in three columns, the
Prussian head quarters, at Marienborn.
Having marched barefooted and with such
exact information, that they passed all the
batteries unperceived, they entered the village
itself, without resistance, and, it is supposed,
would have surprised the commander,
if they had not fired at his windows, beat
their drums, and begun to shout <i>Vive la
Nation!</i> Three balls, which entered the
apartment of General <span class="smallcaps">Kalkreuth</span>, admonished
him to quit it, and a sentinel
stepped up just in time to shoot a French
soldier, who had seized him. Prince Louis
Ferdinand of Prussia immediately arrived
with some troops, and the French began
to retire, leaving thirty prisoners and twenty
killed of 6000, engaged in the enterprise.
The loss of the Prussians was considerable;
amongst the rest Captain Voss, a
relative of Mademoiselle Voss, well known
in the Court of Prussia.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June, the allowance to the
garrison was ordered to be two pounds of
bread and one bottle of wine for each soldier,
per day.</p>

<p>In the night of the 6th and 7th, the cannonade
was very fierce, on both sides; in
Mentz a powder magazine was fired by a
bomb, and blew up with a dreadful explosion.</p>

<p>The scarceness of provisions increased, so
that a pound of fresh butter cost six shillings.
Horseflesh began to be consumed
in many families.</p>

<p>On the night of the 9th and 10th of
June, the garrison made four sorties, which
ended in considerable loss, on both sides,
and in the retirement of the French into
the city. On the 10th, they attacked, at
eight in the morning, a post near Gonsenheim,
retreating without loss, after killing
an officer and several men. This was their
first sally in open day-light.</p>

<p>General Meusnier, who had been wounded
near Cassel, on the 7th, died on the
13th, and was buried the next day, within
the new fortifications, all the officers of the
garrison, with the members of the convention
and clubs, attending.</p>

<p>Some fire ships were now completed,
which a Dutch engineer had conducted
from Holland, to be employed by the besiegers
in burning the bridge of boats over
the Rhine. It was thought, however, that
their explosion would damage the city unnecessarily,
and they were rejected. In the
night of the 15th, one of these floated down
the river, whether by accident, or by the
connivance of the inventor, is not known;
the inhabitants were in the utmost terror,
but it struck against the quay, and, being
immediately boarded, did no damage.</p>

<p>The trenches were opened, in the night
of the 16th and 17th, but, the workmen
having been ill conducted, were not covered
in, at day-light, and were compelled to retire,
leaving their implements behind them.
Two nights afterwards, the work was renewed
in good order and without loss, the
King of Prussia, his sons and the Duke of
Brunswick surveying them from a neighbouring
height. The first balls fell in a
street near one of the gates, and all that
part of the town was presently deserted.</p>

<p>The 24th was a distressful day for the
inhabitants. Four days before, the King of
Prussia had sent a general passport for such
as chose to come out, and 1500 persons,
chiefly women and children, had accepted
his offer. A short time after the gate had
been opened, dismay was spread through
the whole city by an account, that the
Prussians would suffer no more to pass and
the French none to return. The bridge was
covered with these unhappy fugitives, who
had no food, or shelter, and who thought
themselves within reach of the Hockheim
batteries, that played furiously upon the
city. Two children lost their senses through
fright. At length, the French soldiers took
compassion upon them; they carried several
persons into the city under their cloaks,
and, the next day, their remonstrances
against the inhumanity of the German
clubbists, who had shut the gates against
this defenceless crowd, obliged them to permit
the return of the whole number.</p>

<p>For several succeeding nights, the garrison
made sorties, with various effect, interrupting,
but not preventing the completion
of the parallel.</p>

<p>At sunset, on the 27th, the besiegers began
a dreadful cannonade and bombardment.
On this night, the steeple of the
church of Notre Dame caught fire; and
during the alarm, excited by an immense
volume of flame, arising in the midst of
the city, the Austrians completely carried
the French posts, near Weissenau. The
next night was equally terrible to the inhabitants;
the flames caught several parts of
the city, amongst others the cathedral;
some of the magazines took fire, and eleven
hundred sacks of corn were burned. The
church, formerly belonging to the Jesuits,
was much injured. The French, intending
to retaliate their last surprise upon the Austrians,
made a fruitless attack upon the
Weissenau redoubt.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June, at mid-day, the
French were driven from a point of land,
near the Main, called the Bleiau. In this
affair, a vessel, with 78 Prussians on board,
drove from her anchor, owing to the unskilfulness
of the crew, and, during a fire,
by which eight men were killed, made towards
the city. The Prussians were taken
prisoners, and exchanged the next day. At
night, the bombardment was renewed; the
<i>Domprobstei</i>, or palace of the Provost, was
burned and several of the neighbouring residences;
in other parts of the city, some
houses were reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The next night, the church of the Franciscans
and several other public buildings
were destroyed. A dreadful fire, on the
night of the 2d and 4th of June, consumed
the chapel of St. Alban. Families in the
southern part of the city now constantly
passed the night in their cellars; in the day-time,
they ventured into their usual apartments;
for the batteries of the besiegers
were by far the most terrible, at night,
when the whole city was a sufficient mark
for them, though their works could scarcely
be discerned by the garrison. In the day-time,
the exactness of the French gunners
frequently did great injury to the batteries,
which, at night, were repaired and used
with equal effect against the city.</p>

<p>St. Alban's fort was now demolished, so
that the besieged withdrew their cannon
from it. Elizabeth fort was also much damaged.
A strong work, which the French
had raised, in prolongation of the <i>glacis</i>,
divided the opinions of the Prussian engineers.
Some thought it should be preserved,
when taken, because it would command
part of the town; others, that it
should be demolished. The latter opinion
prevailed, and, in the night of the 5th and
6th, General <span class="smallcaps">Manstein</span> was ordered to
make the attack with three battalions. He
perfectly succeeded, as to the nearest part
of the work; but the other, on account of
its solid foundation, could not be entirely
destroyed. In the mean time, two battalions
were sent, under cover of the darkness,
to attack the Zahlbach fort, a part of which
they carried by storm; but the reinforcements,
immediately supplied by the garrison,
obliged them to retire. Two Prussian
officers were killed; one wounded, and
another, with one-and-thirty men, taken.
The Prussians lost in all 183 men; the
French had twelve killed and forty-seven
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 6th of July, the French repaired
the damaged fort, the distance of it from
the Prussians preventing the latter from hindering
them.</p>

<p>At night, General Kleist carried the fort,
at Zahlbach, by a second attack, and demolished
it; at the same time, some batteries
of the second parallel were perfected.
The French could not support the loss of
this fort; on the 7th, they attacked the
scite; carried it, after a severe contest; and
rebuilt it. At night, they were driven back
again and the fort entirely destroyed. In
the same night they were driven from
Kostheim, after a furious battle, by the
Prussian General Schonfield. During this
engagement, the rapid succession of flashes
and explosion of bombs seemed to fill the
air with flame. A Prussian detachment
having been posted on the road to Cassel, in
order to prevent the garrison of that place
from sending succour to Kostheim, this
road was so strongly bombarded by the
French, that seven bombs were frequently
seen in the air at once. The loss was great,
on both sides, in this engagement, after
which the Council in the city resolved, to
make no more attempts upon Kostheim, on
account of the distance.</p>

<p>The following night, the fire was less
than usual, but a few bombs and grenades
fell in the city, where the inhabitants had
now learned to extinguish such as grounded,
before their <i>fusees</i> were consumed. They
also formed themselves into parties for the
ready suppression of fires. The next morning,
the garrison saw the works of the besiegers
brought to within two hundred and
fifty paces of the walls.</p>

<p>About this time, the sickliness of the
garrison became apparent, and General D'Oyr&eacute;
informed the Council, that, on account of
this and of the fatiguing service of the
works, he feared the defence could not be
much longer continued. He lamented,
that the troops of the line were so few,
and the others so inexperienced.</p>

<p>For several nights, the works of the besiegers
were eagerly pushed, but still they
were not so forward, as had been expected.
Some of the besieging corps began to be
sickly; the King of Prussia having resolved
to employ no more labourers, it was
reckoned, that the soldiers, for eight-and-forty
hours of work, had only eighteen of
rest. On the other hand, they were assured,
that the garrison must be equally fatigued,
since, in such an extensive fortification,
none could be left long unemployed.</p>

<p>The French had been, for some time,
busied in forming what is called a Fleche at
the head of one of their forts, and this was
thought necessary to be destroyed. It was
attacked in the night of the 12th and 13th
by the Austrians; but so much time was
passed in their operations, that the French
fell upon them, in great force, about two
in the morning, and beat them away, with
loss. The Austrians were as little employed
as possible in services of this fort.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July, another battery
was stormed by the Prussians; but, as the
officer, unlike the Austrians, advanced with
too little caution, his party was much hurt
by some pieces of concealed cannon, and
the enterprise failed.</p>

<p>The night of the 13th and 14th was
passed in much agitation by the garrison
and inhabitants. Several of the public
buildings were set fire to and burned by
grenades. The works of the besiegers were
now greatly advanced. The garrison made
five sorties in this night, and were repulsed
in all, losing an hundred men, while the
besiegers lost eight killed and one-and-thirty
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, a cessation of arms
took place from seven o'clock in the morning
till one. In the city, the French celebrated
their annual f&ecirc;te; General d'<span class="smallcaps">Oyr&eacute;</span>
and the troops took the oath, and <span class="smallcaps">Merlin</span>
delivered an address to them. In the Austrian
camp, the Prince de <span class="smallcaps">Cond&eacute;</span> was received
with a <i>feu de joye</i>. During this cessation,
the soldiers upon the different outposts
entered into conversation with each
other, and the French boasted of the difficulties
they laboured under from the length
of the siege.</p>

<p>At night, an affair at the Fleche cost the
allies, who succeeded in part, ninety men;
the French confessed, that this work cost
them in all three hundred. The inhabitants
of the city were again greatly alarmed,
their streets being covered with a shower of
grenades. The laboratory and a part of
the Benedictine abbey were burned, and
two explosions took place at the former.
The whole city shook with each report,
and, in the nearer parts, all the windows
were broken and the doors burst open.
The remainder of the hay and straw was
consumed in this fire; the whole stock of
other forage was reduced to a sufficiency
for four days; and the surgeon's stores were
much damaged.</p>

<p>Still the Fleche prevented the besiegers
from completing their second parallel. It
was, therefore, again attacked, on the night
of the 16th and 17th, Prince Louis Ferdinand
of Prussia commanding at the assault,
in which he was one of twelve officers
wounded. The Fleche was then completely
carried.</p>

<p>The next night was very industriously
spent by the besiegers in forming new batteries,
and those of the second parallel were
raised, before there were cannon enough at
hand to place upon them. The French took
advantage of this, and brought a part of
theirs to bear, so as to enfilade the parallel,
with great effect; the Prussians almost immediately
losing an officer and forty men.</p>

<p>In the city, the sick had now increased so
much, that six hundred men were brought
from Cassel, on the 17th, to re-inforce the
garrison. On the 18th, the commandant
informed the Council, that there was a want
of fodder and such a loss of horses, by desertion,
that there were not cavalry enough
left for service. The soldiers, who knew the
deficiency of medicines and other means
of relief for the wounded, were unwilling
to be led to sorties. Though corn had
not failed, flour, it appeared, soon would,
for some of the mills had been rendered
unserviceable, for the present, by shot, and
others were deserted by the millers.</p>

<p>At night, after an unsuccessful attempt
upon the Fleche, it was resolved, that the
garrison, which had hitherto scarcely suffered
a night to pass, without making some
sorties, should, for the future, adhere solely
to defensive measures. Some engineers proposed
to abandon the whole line of forts,
and others, that two of the largest should
be blown up. The General and Council,
at length, confessed, that they could not
continue the defence, and assured the inhabitants,
who had declared themselves in
their favour, that a longer delay of the surrender
would produce a more severe disposition
of the besiegers towards them, without
increasing the chance of escaping it.</p>

<p>A negotiation, relative to the surrender,
was now begun by <span class="smallcaps">D'Oyr&eacute;</span>, in a letter,
which partly replied to one from the Prussian
commander <span class="smallcaps">Kalkreuth</span>, upon the
subject of the departure of aged persons and
children from the city. Their correspondence
continued till the 20th, and several
letters were exchanged, chiefly upon the
question of the removal, or detention of the
inhabitants, who had attached themselves to
the French; it was then broken off, upon
a disagreement, as to this and some other
points. The firing, on both sides, had in
the mean time continued, and the besiegers
carried on the trenches, though these were
now such an easy mark for the garrison,
that they lost an officer and five-and-twenty
men, in the night of the 19th and 20th.
The next night, the Dominicans' church in
the city took fire, and six French soldiers
were buried under its ruins.</p>

<p>Upon a renewal of the intercourse, the
fire slackened, on the 21st; but, on some
delays in the negotiation, was threatened to
be recommenced. At length, the conditions
of the surrender were settled, and the negotiation
signed, on the 22d of July, by
the two Generals Kalkreuth and D'Oyr&eacute;;
the former having rendered the capitulation
somewhat easier than was expected for the
garrison, because the Duke of Brunswick
had only nineteen thousand men to cover
the siege, and Custine had forty thousand,
which were near enough to attack him.
General <span class="smallcaps">Kalkreuth</span>'s orders are supposed
to have been to obtain possession of the
place, upon any terms, that would give it
him quickly.</p>

<p>At this time, the garrison, which, at the
commencement of the siege, had consisted
of 22,653 men, was reduced to 17,038,
having had 1959 killed, 3334 wounded, or
rendered unserviceable by sickness, and
having lost 322 by desertion.</p>

<p>The loss of the besiegers is stated at about
3000 men.</p>

<p>The consumption of ammunition, on the
part of the French, was found to have been</p>

<table summary="stores_2">
<tr><td align="right">681,850</td><td align="left">pounds of powder,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">106,152</td><td align="left">cannon balls,</td></tr>

</table>

<p class="noindent">and, during the siege, 107 cannon either
burst, or were rendered unserviceable by the
besiegers' shot. Towards the conclusion,
sixty cannon also became useless by the
failure of balls of the proper calibre.</p>

<p>On the 24th and 25th, the garrison
marched out, <span class="smallcaps">Merlin</span> leading the first column
of 7500 men. The members of the
Clubs, who would have gone out with the
troops, were pointed out by the other inhabitants
and detained; but the Elector had
the magnanimity to think of no other retaliation,
than their imprisonment in a tower,
near the Rhine, where they have since remained.</p>

<p>There was now leisure to examine the
city, and it was found, that six churches
were in ruins; that seven mansions of the
nobility had been burned, and that very few
houses had escaped, without some damage.
The surrounding grounds were torn up by
balls and batteries. The works of Cassel
were surrendered entire to the conquerors,
and are an important addition to the
strength of Mentz, already reckoned one of
the strongest and largest fortifications in
Europe. Between Cassel and the ruins of
Kostheim not a tree was to be seen. All
the neighbouring villages were more, or
less, injured, being contended for, as posts,
at the commencement of the siege; and the
country was so much disfigured, that the
proprietors of lands had some difficulty to
ascertain their boundaries.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="MENTZ_2" id="MENTZ_2">MENTZ.</a></h3>

<p>Something has been already said
of the present condition of this city: upon
a review it appears, that from the mention
of churches, palaces, burgesses, quays and
streets, we might be supposed to represent it
as a considerable place, either for splendour,
or commerce, or for having its middle
classes numerously filled. Any such opinion
of Mentz will be very incorrect. After two
broad and somewhat handsome streets, all
the other passages in the city are narrow
lanes, and into these many of the best houses
open, having, for the most part, their lower
windows barricadoed, like those of Cologne.
The disadvantage, with which any buildings
must appear in such situations, is increased
by the neglected condition of these; for a
German has no notion, that the outside of
his house should be clean, even if the inside
is so. An Englishman, who spends a
few hundred pounds in a year, has his house
in better condition, as to neatness, than any
German nobleman's we saw; a Dutchman,
with fifty pounds a year, exceeds both.</p>

<p>The Elector's palace is a large turreted
building of reddish stone, with one front
towards the Rhine, which it commands in
a delightful point of view; but we did not
hear, that it was so much altered, by being
now used as a barrack, as that its appearance
can formerly have been much less suitable
than at present to such a purpose.</p>

<p>On the quay there is some appearance of
traffic, but not much in the city; so that
the transfer of commodities from vessels of
other districts to those of the Electorate
may be supposed to contribute great part
of the show near the river. The commerce
is not sufficient to encourage the building of
warehouses over the quay. The vessels are
ill rigged, and the hulls are entirely covered
with pitch, without paint. About thirty of
these, apparently from forty to seventy tons
burthen, were lying near the quay; and the
war could scarcely have diminished their
usual number, so many being employed in
carrying stores for the armies.</p>

<p>The burgesses are numerous, and have
some privileges, which render their political
condition enviable to the other inhabitants
of the Electorate. But, though these have
invited manufacturers, and somewhat encouraged
commerce, there is not wealth
enough in the neighbouring country, to
make such a consumption, as shall render
many traders prosperous. In point of
wealth, activity and address, the burgesses of
Mentz are much below the opinion, which
must be formed, while German cities are
described and estimated by their importance
in their own country, rather than by a
comparison of their condition with that of
others. A trader, it will be allowed, is at
least as likely to appear to advantage in his
business as in any other state. His intelligence
may surely be, in some degree, judged
of by those, who deal with him; and that
we might know something of those of
Mentz, we passed some of the little time we
were left to ourselves in endeavouring to
buy trifles at their shops.</p>

<p>The idleness and inadvertence we generally
saw are difficult to be conceived; perhaps,
the trouble, experienced in purchasing
a book, may give an idea of them. We
wanted the German pamphlet, from which
most of the above-mentioned particulars of
the siege are extracted; and, as it related to
a topic so general within the place, we
smiled, when our friends said they would
<i>assist</i> us to procure it, during a walk. Two
booksellers, to whom we applied, knew nothing
of it; and one supposed, that an engraved
view of the works would do quite as
well. Passing another shop, a young German
gentleman enquired for it of the master,
who was at the door, and heard, that
we might have it, upon our return, in half
an hour. The door, when we came back,
was shut, and no knocking could procure
it to be opened; so that we were obliged
to send into the dwelling-house. When
the shopman came, he knew nothing of the
book; but, being assured that his master
had promised it, went away, and returned
with a copy in sheets. We paid for this,
and left it to be sewed, which was agreed
to be done, in three hours. At that time,
it was not finished, but might be had in
another hour; and, after that hour, it was
again promised, within two. Finally, it
could not be had, that night, but would be
ready in the morning, and, in the morning,
it was still unfinished; we then went to
Franckfort without it, and it was sent after
us by a friend. This was the most aggravated
instance we saw of a German trader's
manners; but something like it may be almost
every where met with.</p>

<p>From such symptoms and from the infrequency
of wealth among the middle classes
it is apparent, that Mentz could not have
been important, as to commerce, even if
there had been no siege, which is here mentioned
as the cause of all deficiencies, and
certainly is so of many. The destruction
of property, occasioned by it, will not be
soon remedied. The nobility have almost
forsaken a place, where their palaces have
been either destroyed, or ransacked; the
Prince has no residence there; some of the
Germans, who emigrated on account of the
last siege, fled into France; the war-taxes,
as well as the partial maintenance of the
garrison, diminish what property remains;
and all expenditure is upon a reduced footing.</p>

<p>The contribution of the inhabitants towards
a support of the garrison is made by
the very irksome means of affording them
lodging. At the best houses, the doors are
chalked over with the names of officers,
lodged in them; which the servants dare
not efface, for the soldiers must know where
to find their officers. In a family, whom
we visited, four officers and their servants
were quartered; but it must be acknowledged,
that the former, so far from adding
to this inconvenience by any negligent conduct,
were constantly and carefully polite.
We, indeed, never saw Prussian officers
otherwise; and can testify, that they are as
much superior to those Austrians in manners
and intelligence, as they are usually
said to be in military qualities.</p>

<p>Another obstruction, which the siege has
given to the prosperity of Mentz, consists
in the absence of many members of the
Noble Chapter; an institution, which, however
useless, or injurious to the country,
occasions the expenditure of considerable
sums in the capital. That of Mentz is said
to be one of the richest of many similar
Chapters in Germany. From such foundations
the younger sons of noble families
derive sometimes very ample incomes, and
are but little restricted by their regulations
from any enjoyment of temporal splendour.
Their carriages and liveries vie with those
of the other attendants at Court; they are
not prohibited from wearing the ornaments
of orders of knighthood; are very little enjoined
to residence; are received in the
environs of the Court with military honours,
and allowed to reside in their separate
houses. They may wear embroidery of
gold, and cloths of any colours, except
scarlet, or green, which, as well as silver
lace, are thought too gay. Being thus permitted
and enabled to become examples of
luxury, their residence in any city diffuses
some appearance of prosperity over it.</p>

<p>One of the largest buildings in Mentz is
the arsenal, which fronts towards the river,
and attracts the attention of those, who
walk upon the quay, by having armed
heads placed at the windows of the first
floor, which seem to frown, with Roman
sternness, upon the passenger. In one of
the principal rooms within, a party of
figures in similar armour are placed at a
council-board. We did not hear who contrived
them; but the heads in the windows
may be mistaken for real ones, at the distance
of fifty yards.</p>

<p>The Elector of Mentz, who is chosen by
a Chapter of twenty-four Canons, and is
usually one of their number, is the first
ecclesiastical Prince in the empire, of which
he is also the Arch-chancellor and Director
of the Electoral College. In the Diet, he
sits on the right hand of the Emperor, affixes
the seal of the Empire to its decrees, and
has afterwards the custody of them among
the archives. His revenues, in a time of
peace, are nearly 200,000l. annually; but,
during a war, they are much less, a third
part of them arising from tolls, imposed
upon the navigation of the Rhine. The
vineyards supply another large part; and his
subjects, not interested in them, are but
little taxed, except when military preparations
are to be made; the taxes are then
as direct as possible, that money may be
immediately collected.</p>

<p>The fortifications of his chief city are as
much a misfortune to his country as they
are an advantage to the rest of the Empire.
Being always one of the first objects, on
this side of the Rhine, since an enemy cannot
cross the river, while so considerable a
fortress and so large a garrison as it may
contain, might, perhaps, check their return,
the Electorate has been often the scene of a
tedious warfare. From the first raising of
the works by Louis the Fourteenth, their
strength has never been fully tried. The
surrender in 1792 was partly for the want
of a proper garrison, and partly by contrivance;
even in 1793, when the defence
was so furious and long, the garrison, it is
thought, might have held out further, if
their stores had been secured in bomb-proof
buildings. A German garrison, supported
by an army, which should occupy
the opposite bank of the Rhine, might be
continually reinforced and supplied, so as to
be conquered by nothing but the absolute
demolition of the walls.</p>

<p>The bridge of boats over the Rhine,
which, both in peace and war, is so important
to the city, is now in a much better
state than the French found it, being
guarded, at the eastern end, by the fortifications
of Cassel. Notwithstanding its great
length and the rapidity of the river, it is so
well constructed, as to be much less liable
to injury, than might be supposed, and
would probably sustain batteries, which
might defeat every attempt at destroying it
by fireships. It is 766 feet long, and wide
enough for the passage of two carriages at
once. Various repairs, and the care of a
daily survey, have continued it, since 1661,
when it was thrown over the river.</p>

<p>The practice of modifying the names of
towns so as to incorporate them separately
with every language, is no where more
remarkable than with respect to those of
Germany, where a stranger, unless he is
aware of them, might find the variations
very inconvenient. The German name for
what we call Mentz, is <i>Maynz</i>; the French,
which is most used, <i>Mayence</i>; and the Italian
<i>Magontio</i>, by descent from the Roman
<i>Magontiacum</i>. The German synonym for
Liege is <i>Luttich</i>; for Aix la Chapelle,
<i>Achen</i>; for Bois le Duc, <i>Herzogenbusch</i>;
and for Cologne, <i>C&ouml;ln</i>, which is pronounced
<i>Keln</i>. The name borne by every town in
the nation to which it belongs, should surely
be its name, wherever it is mentioned;
for the same reason, that words, derived
into one language from another, are
pronounced according to the authority of their
roots, because the use of the primary term
is already established, and there can never
be a decision between subsequent varieties,
which are cotemporary among themselves,
and are each produced by the same arrogance
of invention.</p>

<h3><a name="FRANCKFORT" id="FRANCKFORT">FRANCKFORT.</a></h3>

<p>We came hither by means of a
passage boat, which we were told would
shew something of the German populace,
but which displayed nothing so much as
the unskilfulness of the German sailors.
Though they make this voyage, every day,
they went aground in the even stream of
the Maine, and during the calmest weather;
fixing the vessel so fast by their ill-directed
struggle to get off, that they were compelled
to bring the towing horses to the side
and tug backward with the stream. There
were an hundred people in the boat; but
the expedient of desiring them to remove
from the part, which was aground, was
never used. We heard, that they seldom
make the voyage, without a similar stoppage,
not against any shifting sand, but upon
the permanent shelves of the river.</p>

<p>The distance is about four-and-twenty
miles, but we were nine hours in reaching
Franckfort, the environs of which afford
some symptoms of a commercial and opulent
city, the banks of the Maine being covered
for nearly the last mile with country
seats, separated from each other by small
pleasure grounds.</p>

<p>There are gates and walls to Franckfort,
but the magistrates do not oppress travellers
by a military examination at their entrance.
Having seen the worthlessness of many
places, which bear ostentatious characters
either for splendour or trade, we were
surprised to find in this as much of both as had
been reported. The quays were well covered
with goods and labourers; the streets
nearest to the water are lined with shops,
and those in the middle of the city with the
houses of merchants, of which nearly all
are spacious, and many magnificent. Some,
indeed, might be called palaces, if they had
nobility for their tenants; but, though the
independence, which commerce spreads
among the middle classes, does not entirely
deter the German nobility from a residence
here, the finest houses are the property of
merchants.</p>

<p>In our way to the <i>Cigne Blanc</i>, which is
one of the best inns, we passed many of so
good an appearance, that it was difficult to
believe there could be better in a German
city. But Franckfort, which is the pride
of Germany, in this respect, has probably a
greater number of large inns than any other
place of equal extent in Europe. The fairs
fill these, twice in a year, for three weeks,
at each time; and the order, which is indispensible
then, continues at other periods,
to the surprise and comfort of strangers.</p>

<p>This city has been justly described by
many travellers; and Doctor <span class="smallcaps">Moore</span> has
treated of its inhabitants with the ease and
elegant animation of his peculiar manner.
We shall not assume the disadvantage of entering
upon the same subject after him.
The inhabitants of Franckfort are very
distinct, as to manners and information,
from the other Germans; but they are so
far like to those of our own commercial
cities, that one able account leaves scarcely
any thing new to be seen, or told, concerning
them.</p>

<p>All their blessings of liberty, intelligence,
and wealth are observed with the more attention,
because they cannot be approached,
except through countries afflicted by arbitrary
power, ignorance and poverty. The
existence of such a city, in such a situation,
is little less than a <i>phenomenon</i>; the causes
of which are so various and minute as to
make the effect, at first sight, appear almost
accidental. The jealousy of the neighbouring
Princes towards each other, is the
known, and, certainly, the chief cause of
its exterior protection against each; the
continuance of its interior liberties is probably
owing to the circumstance, which,
but for that jealousy, would expose it to
subjection from without,&mdash;the smallness of
its territory. Where the departments of
government must be very few, very difficult
to be rendered expensive to the public, and
very near to their inspection, the ambition
of individuals can be but little tempted to
contrive encroachments upon the community.
So complexly are the chief causes
of its exterior and interior independence
connected with each other.</p>

<p>As to the first of these, it may, perhaps,
be replied, that a similar jealousy has not
always been sufficient to protect similar
cities; and Dantzick is the recent instance
of its insufficiency. But the jealousy, as to
Dantzick, though similar, was not equal to
this, and the temptation to oppose it was
considerably greater. What would the most
capable of the neighbouring Princes gain
by the seizure of Franckfort? A place of
strength? No. A place capable of paying
taxes? Yes; but taxes, which would be
re-imposed upon commodities, consumed
partly by his own subjects, whose property
is his own already, and partly by those
of his neighbours, to whose jealousy they
would afford an additional and an unappeasable
provocation. Dantzick, on the
contrary, being a seaport, was, if not strong,
capable of supplying strength, and might
pay taxes, which should not fall entirely
upon its neighbours, but upon the distant
countries, that traffick with it. And even
to these considerations it is unnecessary to
resort, unless we can suppose, that despotism
would have no effect upon commerce; a
supposition which does not require to be
refuted. If a severe taxation was introduced
here, and, in so small a district, taxation
must be severe to be productive; if
such a taxation was to be introduced, and
if the other advantage of conquest, that of
a forcible levy of soldiers, was attempted,
commerce would vanish in silence before
the oppressor, and the Prince, that should
seize the liberties of Franckfort, would find
nothing but those liberties in his grasp.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what are the advantages
of permitting the independence of
such a city to the sovereigns, who have the
power of violating it? Those of a neutral
barrier are well known, but apply only to
military, or political circumstances. The
others are the market, which Franckfort
affords, for the produce and manufactures
of all the neighbouring states; its value as
a banking <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> and <i>emporium</i>, in which
Princes may place their money, without
rendering it liable to the orders of each
other, or from which they may derive
loans, by negotiating solely and directly
with the lenders; its incapacity for offensive
measures; and its usefulness as a place
of meeting to themselves, or their ministers,
when political connections are to be discussed.</p>

<p>That the inhabitants do enjoy this independence
without and freedom within, we
believe, not because they are asserted by
treaties, or political forms; of which the
former might not have survived the temporary
interests, that concluded them, and
the latter might be subdued by corruption,
if there were the means of it; but because
they were acknowledged to us by many
temperate and discerning persons, as much
aloof from faction, as they were from the
affectation, or servility, that sometimes
makes men boast themselves free, only because
they have, or would be thought to
have, a little share in oppressing others.
Many such persons declared to us, that they
had a substantial, practical freedom; and
we thought a testimony to their actual enjoyments
more valuable than any formal
acknowledgments of their rights. As to
these latter securities, indeed, Franckfort is
no better provided than other imperial cities,
which have proved their inutility. It stands
in the same list with Cologne, but is as superior
to it in government as in wealth.</p>

<p>The inhabitants having had the good
sense to foresee, that fortifications might
render them a more desirable prize to their
neighbours, at the same time that their real
protection must depend upon other means,
have done little more than sustain their antient
walls, which are sufficient to defend
them against a surprise by small parties.
They maintain no troops, except a few
companies of city-guards, and make their
contributions to the army of the Empire in
specie. These companies are filled chiefly
with middle-aged men, whose appearance
bespeaks the plenty and peacefulness of the
city. Their uniforms, blue and white, are
of the cut of those in the prints of <span class="smallcaps">Marlborough's</span>
days; and their grenadiers'
caps are of the same peaked sort, with tin
facings, impressed with the city arms.</p>

<p>In wars with France, the fate of Franckfort
has usually depended upon that of
Mentz, which is properly called the key of
Germany, on the western frontier. In the
campaign of 1792, Custine detached 3000
troops of the 11,000, with which he had
besieged Mentz, and these reached Franckfort,
early in the morning of the 22d of
October. <span class="smallcaps">Neuwinger</span>, their commander,
sent a letter to the magistrates from Custine,
demanding a contribution of two millions
of florins, which, by a negotiation at Mentz,
was reduced to a million and a half, for the
present. Notice was accordingly given in
the city, that the magistrates would receive
money at four per cent. interest, and, on
the 23d, at break of day, it began to flow
in to the Council-house from all quarters.
Part was immediately given to <span class="smallcaps">Neuwinger</span>,
but payment of the rest was delayed;
so that Custine came himself on the 27th,
and, by throwing the hostages into prison,
obtained, on the 31st of October, the remainder
of the first million. For the second,
the magistrates gave security to <span class="smallcaps">Neuwinger</span>,
but it was never paid; the Convention
disavowed great part of the proceedings
of Custine, and the money was not again
demanded.</p>

<p>The French, during the whole of their
stay, were very eager to spread exaggerated
accounts of their numbers. Troops were
accordingly marched out at one gate of the
city, with very little parade, that they might
enter with much pomp and in a longer column,
at the other. The inhabitants, who
were not expert at military numeration,
easily believed, that the first party had
joined other troops, and that the whole
amounted to treble their real number.
After the entry of the Prussians, this contrivance
was related by prisoners.</p>

<p>The number of troops, left in the city
by Custine, on his retirement from the
neighbouring posts, in the latter end of
November, was 1800 men, with two pieces
of cannon. On the 28th, when the Prussian
Lieutenant Pellet brought a summons
to surrender, Helden, the commander,
having sent to Custine for reinforcements
and cannon, was answered, that no men
could be spared; and that, as to cannon,
he might use the city artillery. Helden
endeavoured to remove this from the arsenal;
but the populace, encouraged by the
neighbourhood of the Prussians, rose to prevent
him; and there might have been a
considerable tumult, if Custine had not arrived,
on the 29th, and assured the magistrates,
that the garrison should retire, rather
than expose the place to a siege. The city
then became tranquil, and remained so till
the 2d of December, when the inhabitants,
being in church, first knew by the noise of
cannon, that the place was attacked.</p>

<p>General Helden would then have taken
his two cannon to the gate, which was contended
for, but the inhabitants, remembering
Custine's promise, would permit no resistance;
they cut the harness of the horses,
broke the cannon wheels, and themselves
opened the gates to the Prussians, or rather
to the Hessians, for the advanced corps of
the assailants was chiefly formed of them.
About 100 fell in this attack. Of the
French 41 were killed; 139 wounded; and
800 taken prisoners. The remainder of the
1800 reached Custine's army. A monument,
erected without the northern gate of
the city, commemorates the loss of the 100
assailants, on the spot, on which they fell.</p>

<p>Thus Franckfort, having happily but few
fortifications, was lost and regained, without
a siege; while Mentz, in a period of six
more months, had nearly all its best buildings
destroyed, by a similar change of masters.</p>

<p>We stayed here almost a week, which
was well occupied by visits, but shewed
nothing in addition to what is already
known of the society of the place. Manners,
customs, the topics of conversation and
even dress, differ very slightly from those of
London, in similar ranks; the merchants of
Franckfort have more generally the advantages
of travel, than those of England, but
they have not that minute knowledge of
modern events and characters, which an
attention to public transactions renders
common in our island. Those, who have
been in England, or who speak English,
seem desirous to discuss the state of parliamentary
transactions and interests, and to
remedy the thinness of their own public
topics, by introducing ours. In such discussions
one error is very general from their
want of experience. The faculty of making
a speech is taken for the standard of intellectual
power in every sort of exertion;
though there is nothing better known in
countries, where public speakers are numerous
enough to be often observed, than that
persons may be educated to oratory, so as
to have a facility, elegance and force in it,
distinct from the endowments of deliberative
wisdom; may be taught to speak in
terms remote from common use, to combine
them with an unfailing dexterity of
arrangement, and to invest every thought
with its portion of artificial dignity, who,
through the chaos of benefits and evils,
which the agitation of difficult times throws
up before the eye of the politician, shall be
able to see no gleam of light, to describe no
direct path, to discern no difference between
greater and lesser evils, nor to think one
wholesome truth for a confiding and an
honest country. To estimate the general
intellectual powers of men, tutored to oratory,
from their success in the practice of
it, is as absurd as to judge of corporeal
strength from that of one arm, which may
have been rendered unusually strong by
exercise and art.</p>

<p>Of the society at Franckfort, Messrs.
Bethman, the chief bankers, seem able to
collect a valuable part; and their politeness
to strangers induces them to do it often.
A traveller, who misses their table, loses,
both as to conversation and elegant hospitality,
a welcome proof of what freedom
and commerce can do against the mental
and physical desolation otherwise spread
over the country.</p>

<p>The assistance, which the mutual use of
languages gives to a connection between
distant places, we were happy to see existing
and increasing, to the advantage of
England, at Franckfort. At the Messrs.
Bethmans', one day, French was nearly excluded,
the majority being able to converse
with nine or ten English, who were there,
in their own language. Of the merchants,
who have not been in England, several
speak English, without difficulty, and the
rising generation, it is said, will be generally
accomplished in it.</p>

<p>One of the luxuries of Franckfort is a
<i>Cabinet Literaire</i>, which is open to strangers
by the introduction of members. There
the best periodical publications of the Continent
are received, and their titles immediately
entered in a book, so that the reading
is not disturbed by conversation with
the librarian. It excited our shame to hear,
that some contrivance had, for several
months, prevented the society from receiving
a very valuable English publication.</p>

<p>After this, the Theatre may seem to require
some notice. It is a modern, but not
an elegant building, standing in an area,
that renders it convenient of access, and
nearly in the middle of the city. The interior,
which has been gaudily decorated,
contains a pit, three rows of boxes, that
surround the audience part, and a gallery
over them in the centre. It is larger than
the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and,
in form, resembles that of Covent Garden,
except that six or seven of the central boxes,
in each tier, encroach upon the oval figure
by a projection over the pit. The boxes
are let by the year; the price of admission
for non-subscribers, is a florin, for which
they may find places in the box, engaged
by their friends, or in the pit, which is in
the same proportion of esteem as that at an
Opera-house.</p>

<p>The performances are plays and operas
alternately; both in German; and the music
of the latter chiefly by German composers.
The players are very far beneath
mediocrity; but the orchestra, when we
heard it, accorded with the fame of German
musicians, for spirit and precision. In these
qualities even the wandering parties, that
play at inns, are very seldom deficient.</p>

<p>The stage was well lighted, but the other
parts of the theatre were left in duskiness,
which scarcely permitted us to see the diamonds,
profusely worn by several ladies.
Six o'clock is the hour of beginning, and
the performances conclude soon after nine.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Literaire and the Theatre
are the only permanent places of public
amusement at Franckfort, which is, however,
in want of no more, the inhabitants
being accustomed to pass much of their
time in friendly parties, at their houses.
Though wealth is, of course, earnestly and
universally sought for in a place purely
mercantile, we were assured, that the richest
persons, and there are some, who have
above half a million sterling, find no more
attention in these parties than others. This
was acknowledged and separately boasted of
by some of the very rich, and by those
who were comparatively poor. We are so
far able to report it for true, as that we
could never discern the least traces of the
officiousness, or subserviency that, in a corrupt
and debased state of society, frequently
point to the wealthiest individuals in every
private party.</p>

<p>These and many other circumstances
would probably render Franckfort a place
of residence for foreigners, if the magistrates,
either dreading the increase of luxury,
or the interference of strangers with
their commerce, did not prevent this by
prohibiting them from being lodged otherwise
than at inns. It was with difficulty,
that an English officer, acting as Commissary
to some of the German regiments,
lately raised upon our pay, could obtain an
exemption from this rule, at the request of
the Hanoverian Minister.</p>

<p>Round the city, are several well-disposed
walks, as pleasant as the flatness of the
nearer country will permit; and, at intervals,
along these, are the country houses of
the merchants, who do not choose to go beyond
the city territories, for a residence.
Saxenhausen, a small town, on the other
side of the Maine, though incorporated with
Franckfort, as to jurisdiction, and connected
with it by a bridge, is chiefly inhabited by
watermen and other labourers.</p>

<p>We left Franckfort, after a stay of six
days, fortified by a German passport from
M. de Swartzhoff, the Hanoverian Minister,
who obligingly advised us to be prepared
with one in the native language of the
Austrian officers. At Mentz, the ceremonies
of examination were rendered much
more troublesome than before, the Governor,
General Kalkreuth, happening to be
in the great square, who chose to make several
travellers wait as if for a sort of review
before him, though, after all, nothing
was to be said but "Go to the Commandant,
who will look at your passports."
This Commandant was M. de Lucadou, a
gentleman of considerate and polite manners,
who, knowing our friends in Mentz,
added to his confirmation of M. de Swartzhoff's
passport an address to M. de Wilde,
the Intendant of some salt mines in Switzerland,
which he recommended to us to
see. These circumstances are necessary to
be mentioned here, because they soon led
to a disagreeable and very contradictory
event in our journey.</p>

<p>The next morning, we set out from
Mentz, and were conducted by our voiturier
over a summer road, on the left bank of the
Rhine, then flowing with the melted snows
of Switzerland.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="OPPENHEIM" id="OPPENHEIM">OPPENHEIM.</a></h3>

<p>This is the first town of the Palatinate,
on arriving from the north; and it
bears marks of the devastation, inflicted
upon that country, in the last century, more
flagrant than could be expected, when the
length of the intervening time, and the
complete recovery of other cities from similar
disasters, are considered. Louis the Fourteenth's
fury has converted it from a populous
city into little more than a picturesque
ruin. It was burned in 1668; and the
walls, which remain in double, or sometimes
in treble circles, are more visible, at
a distance, than the streets, which have been
thinly erected within them. Above all, is
the <i>Landscroon</i>, or crown of the country, a
castle erected on an eminence, which commands
the Rhine, and dignifies the view
from it, for several miles. The whole city,
or rather ruin, stands on a brow, over this
majestic river.</p>

<p>The gates do not now open directly into
streets, but into lanes of stone walls between
vineyards and gardens, formed on the site
of houses, never restored, since the fire.
The town itself has shrunk from its antient
limits into a few streets in the centre. In
some of the interstices, corn grows up to
the walls of the present houses. In others
the ruins of former buildings remain, which
the owners have not been tempted to remove,
for the sake of cultivating their sites.
Of the cathedral, said to have been once
the finest on the Rhine, nearly all the walls
and the tower still exist; but these are the
only remains of grandeur in a city, which
seems entirely incapable of overcoming in
this century the wretchedness it inherits
from the last.</p>

<p>Had the walls been as strong as they are
extensive, this place might not improbably
have endured a siege in the present age,
having been several times lost and regained.
It was surrendered to the French, without
a contest, in the campaign of 1792. After
their retreat from Worms, and during the
siege of Mentz, it was occupied by the
Prussians; and, in December 1793, when
the allies retired from Alsace, the Duke of
Brunswick established his head-quarters in
it, for the purpose of covering the fortress.
His army ovens remained near the northern
gate, in July 1794, when we passed
through it. In October of the same year
it fell again into the hands of the French.</p>

<p>No city on the banks of the Rhine is so
well seated for affording a view of it as this,
which, to the north, overlooks all its windings
as far as Mentz, and, southward, commands
them towards Worms. The river
is also here of a noble breadth and force,
beating so vehemently against the watermills,
moored near the side, that they seem
likely to be borne away with the current.
A city might be built on the site of Oppenheim,
which should faintly rival the castle
of Goodesberg, in the richness, though not
in the sublimity of its prospect.</p>

<p>From hence the road leads through a
fertile country of corn and vines, but at a
greater distance from the river, to Worms,
five or six miles from which it becomes
broad, straight, and bordered with regularly-planted
trees, that form an avenue to
the city. Soon after leaving Oppenheim,
we had the first symptom of an approach
to the immediate theatre of the war, meeting
a waggon, loaded with wounded soldiers.
On this road, there was a long train of
carriages, taking stores to some military <i>dep&ocirc;t</i>.
The defacement of the Elector's arms, on
posts near the road, shewed also, that the
country had been lately occupied by the
French; as the delay in cutting the ripe
corn did, that there was little expectation of
their return.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="WORMS" id="WORMS">WORMS.</a></h3>

<p>The condition of Worms is an aggravated
repetition of the wretchedness of
Oppenheim. It suffered something in the
war, which the unfortunate Elector, son-in-law
of our James the First, provoked by
accepting the kingdom of Bohemia. Louis
the Fourteenth came upon it next, and, in
1669, burned every thing that could be
consumed. Nothing was restored, but on
that part, which was the centre of the antient
city; and the walls include, as at
Oppenheim, corn and vineyards upon the
ground, which was once covered with
houses, and which plainly appears to have
been so, from the lanes that pass between,
and doors that open into the inclosures. A
much larger space is so covered, than at
Oppenheim, for you are some time in
driving from the northern gate of the old
city to the first street of the present one.</p>

<p>On the right of the road stands the
skeleton of the Electoral palace, which the
French burned in one of the late campaigns;
and it is as curious as melancholy
to observe how the signs of antient and
modern desolation mingle with each other.
On one hand is a palace, burned by the
present French; on the other, the walls of
a church, laid open by Louis the Fourteenth.</p>

<p>The first and principal street of the place
leads through these mingled ruins, and
through rows of dirty houses, miserably
tenanted, to the other end of the city.
A few others branch from it, chiefly towards
the Rhine, including sometimes the
ruins, and sometimes the repaired parts
of churches; of which streets, narrow, ill-paved
and gloomy, consists the city of
Worms. The French General, that lately
wrote to Paris, "We entered the fair episcopal
city of Worms," may be supposed to
have derived his terms from a geographical
dictionary, rather than from a view of his
conquest.</p>

<p>We were now in a place, occupied by
part of the acting army of the allies, which,
if not immediately liable to be attacked,
was to be defended by the maintenance of
posts, at a very short distance. Troops
passed through it daily, for the service of
these posts. The noise of every cannonade
was audible, and the result of every engagement
was immediately known, for it
might make an advance, or a retreat
necessary from Worms. The wounded men
arrived, soon after the intelligence, to the
military hospitals of the Prussians. A city,
so circumstanced, seemed to differ but little
from a camp; and we were aware, for a
few hours, of a departure from the security
and order of civil life.</p>

<p>The inn, which was not otherwise a
mean building, was nearly destitute of furniture;
so that the owner was prepared to
receive any sort of guests, or masters. The
only provision which we could obtain was
bread, the commonest sort of wine, and one
piece of cold veal; for the city was under
military jurisdiction, and no guests were
allowed to have more than one dish at their
table.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we saw, for the first
time, a crowd in a German city. A narrow
waggon, of which nearly all but the wheels
was basket-work, had arrived from the army,
with a wounded officer, who lay upon the
floor, supported by his servant, but occasionally
rose to return the salutes of passengers.
This was the Prince of Anhalt Plessis,
who had been wounded, in the morning,
when the French attacked all the neighbouring
lines of the allies, and an indecisive
engagement ensued, the noise of which had
been distinctly heard, at Worms. He was
hurt in the leg, and descended, with much
difficulty, from the waggon; but did not,
for an instant, lose the elegance of his address,
and continued bowing through the
passage to his apartment. No doubt was
entertained of his recovery, but there seemed
to be a considerable degree of sympathy,
attending this young man.</p>

<p>We had not time to look into the
churches, or numerous monasteries, that
yet remain, at Worms; the war appeared
to have depopulated the latter, for not a
monk was to be seen. The cathedral, or
church of St. Mary and St. Peter, is one of
the most antient sacred buildings in Germany,
having been founded at least as early
as the commencement of the seventh century.
One of the prebends was established
in 1033, another in 1058. The Dominicans,
Carmelites, Capuchins and Augustines
have each a monastery, at Worms; as have
the Cistercians and the Augustines a nunnery.
A Protestant church was also consecrated,
on the 9th of June 1744; something
more than two hundred years, after
the ineffectual conference held here of Protestant
and Catholic divines, which Charles
the Fifth interrupted, when Melancthon, on
one side, and Echius, on the other, had engaged
in it, ordering them to resume their
arguments, in his presence, at Ratisbon.
This meeting was five years previous to
the celebrated diet of Worms, at which
Charles, having then estimated the temporal
strength of the two parties, openly shewed
his animosity to the Protestants, as Maurice
of Saxony did his intriguing ambition, by
referring the question to the Council of
Trent.</p>

<p>The Jews, at Worms, inhabit a separate
street, and have a synagogue, of great antiquity,
their numbers having been once
such as to endanger the peace of the city;
but, in 1689, when the French turned their
synagogue into a stable, they fled with the
rest of the opulent inhabitants to Holland.
Those of the present day can have very few
articles of traffic, except money, the changing
of which may have been frequent, on
account of the neighbourhood of France.</p>

<p>Worms is somewhat connected with English
history, having been occupied by the
troops, which James the First uselessly sent
to the assistance of the proscribed Elector
Palatine, when his just abhorrence of continental
wars was once, though tardily,
overcome by the entreaties of his daughter.
Here too George the Second held his
head-quarters, from the 7th to the 20th of September
1743; on the 14th of which month,
Lord Carteret concluded, in his name, an
offensive and defensive treaty with the
Ministers of Hungary and Sardinia.</p>

<p>This city, like Cologne, retains some
affectation of the Roman form of government,
to which it was rendered subject by
C&aelig;sar, with the title of <i>Augusta Vangionum</i>.
The <span class="smallcaps">Stadtmeister</span> is sometimes called
the <span class="smallcaps">Consul</span>, and the <span class="smallcaps">Schultheis</span>, or
Mayor, the <span class="smallcaps">Pr&aelig;tor</span>. But, in 1703, some
trivial tumult afforded a pretence for abolishing
its little remains of liberty, and the
Elector Palatine was declared its protector.
This blow completed the desolation, which
the disasters of the preceding century had
commenced; and a city, that was once
called the market of the Palatinate, as the
Palatinate was reputed the market of Germany,
continues to exhibit nothing more
than the ruins of its antient prosperity.</p>

<p>Few of the present inhabitants can be the
descendants of those, who witnessed its
destruction in 1689; for we could not find,
that the particulars of that event were much
known, or commemorated by them, dreadful
and impressive as they must have been.
A column of Louis the Fourteenth's army
had entered the city, in September of the
preceding year, under the command of the
Marquis de Bonfleur, who soon distressed
the inhabitants by preparations for blowing
up the walls with gunpowder. The mines
were so numerous and large, as to threaten
nothing less than the entire overwhelming
of the city; but, being fired at different
times, the walls of the houses were left
standing, though they shook with almost
every explosion. The artillery and balls
had been previously carried away to Landau,
or Mentz, then possessed by Louis.
At length, on the 12th of May 1689, the
Intendant sent the melancholy news to the
magistracy, that he had received orders from
his monarch to burn the whole city. Six
days were allowed for the departure of the
inhabitants and the removal of their property;
which period was prolonged by
their entreaties to nineteen. At the expiration
of these, on Ascension Day, the 31st
of May, the French grenadiers were employed
from twelve o'clock, till four, in
placing combustibles about the houses and
public buildings, against several of which
large heaps of hay and straw were raised.
The word being then given, fire was set
to almost every house at once, and, in a
few hours, the city was reduced to ashes;
the conflagration being so general and strong
as to be visible in day-light at the distance
of more than thirty English miles. Such
was one of the calamities of a city, so unfortunately
situated, that the chapter of the
cathedral alone proved a loss by wars, previous
to the year 1743, amounting to
1,262,749 florins.</p>

<p>The attention, due to so memorable a
place, detained us at Worms, till the voiturier
talked of being unable to reach Manheim,
before the gates would be shut, and
we let him drive vehemently towards</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="FRANCKENTHAL" id="FRANCKENTHAL">FRANCKENTHAL,</a></h3>

<p>Another place, destroyed by Louis
the Fourteenth, but restored upon a plan so
uniform and convenient, that nothing but a
fuller population is necessary to confirm its
title of a flourishing city. The streets,
which intersect each other at right angles,
are wide and exactly straight; the houses
are handsomely built, but the poverty or
indolence of the owners suffers them to partake
of the air of neglect, which is general
in German habitations; and the streets,
though spacious and not ill-paved, had so
few passengers, that the depopulation of the
place seemed to be rendered the more observable
by its grandeur.</p>

<p>Yet it would be unfair to estimate the
general prosperity of Franckenthal by its
present circumstances, even had we stayed
long enough to know them more accurately.
This place had been occupied but a
few weeks before by the French army, who
had plundered it, as well as several other
towns of the Palatinate, after the retreat of
the allies from Alsace, at the latter end of
1793. The inhabitants had, for the most
part, returned to their houses; but their
commerce, which is said to have been not
contemptible, could not be so easily restored.
The manufactures of porcelain, cloths, silks,
spangles, vinegar and soap, of which some
were established and all are protected by the
wise liberality of the Elector, though far
from being answerable, either in their capitals,
or produce, to the English idea of
similar enterprises, command some share
with England and France in supplying the
rest of Germany. One method of facilitating
the operations of trade the Elector
has advantageously adopted here; that of
instituting a court upon the spot for the decision
of all causes, in which the traders are
interested; and at his expence a navigable
canal has been formed from the town to
the Rhine. Artists and merchants have also
some privileges, at Franckenthal, of which
that of being exempt from the military press
is not the least.</p>

<p>This press, or levy, is the method, by
which all the German Princes return their
contingents to the army of the Empire.
The population of every town and district
in their dominions is known with sufficient
accuracy, and a settled number of recruits
is supplied by each. When these are wanted,
notice is given, that the men of a certain
age must assemble and cast lots for the service.
Those, who are drawn, may find
substitutes, but with this condition, that the
deputy must be at least as tall as his principal;
a regulation, which makes the price
of substitutes depend upon their height, and
frequently renders it impossible for the
principals to avail themselves of the permission.
A farmer in this neighbourhood,
who was considerably above six feet in
height, could not obtain a substitute for
less than a hundred louis d'ors.</p>

<p>Another unpleasant condition is attached
to this exchange: if the substitute is disabled,
or deserts, another must be supplied;
and, if he carries his arm or accoutrements
away, these must be paid for by the
person, who sent him.</p>

<p>After a ride of a few miles, we reached</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="OGGERSHEIM" id="OGGERSHEIM">OGGERSHEIM,</a></h3>

<p>A small town, on the west bank
of the Rhine, rebuilt in uniform streets, like
Franckenthal, having been destroyed by the
same exertion of Louis the Fourteenth's
cruelty. Here also the modern French had
very lately been, and some of the ruins, left
near the road by Louis, appeared to have
served them for kitchens in their excursion.</p>

<p>At the east end of the town, towards the
Rhine, stands a chateau of the Elector, built
with modern, but not very admirable taste,
and commanding the distant river in several
fine points of view. We could not be admitted
to see the inside, which is said to
have been splendidly decorated; for the
French had just dismantled it of the furniture.</p>

<p>The road from hence to Manheim was
bordered for its whole length, of at least
two miles, by rows of poplars, of which
some still remain near Oggersheim; but
those within a mile and a half of Manheim
have been felled at one or two feet from
the ground. This was done in December
1793, when the French began to advance
from Landau, and were expected to besiege
Manheim, their operations against which
might have been covered, in some measure,
by this noble alley.</p>

<p>Near the Rhine, the road is now commanded
by two forts, of which one was
thrown up during the approach of the
French, and completed in the middle of
the summer, with great care. These contribute
much to the present security of the
city, which might otherwise be bombarded
from the opposite bank of the river, even
by an enemy, who should not be able and
should not propose to attempt the conquest
of the place. They are ditched and
pallisadoed, but, being divided from the body
of the city, by the Rhine, are, of course,
without the communication, which renders
such works capable of a long defence.
Round one of these forts, the road now
winds, entering a part of the works, near
the bridge, where there is a guard-house for
the troops of the Elector.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h3><a name="MANHEIM" id="MANHEIM">MANHEIM.</a></h3>

<p>It was twilight, when we approached
Manheim; and the palace, the numerous
turrets and the fortifications had their
grandeur probably increased by the obscurity.
The bridge of boats is not so long
as that at Mentz; but we had time enough
in passing it to observe the extent of the
city, on the left of which the Neckar pours
itself into the Rhine, so that two sides are
entirely washed by their streams. At the
next guard-house, where we were detained
by the usual enquiries, the troops were more
numerous; and surely no military figures
ever accorded so well with the gloomy
gates, and walls they guarded. The uniform
of the Palatine light troops is a close
jacket of motley brown, and pantaloons of
the same that reach to their half-boots.
They have black helmets, with crests and
fronts of brass, large whiskers, and their
faces, by constant exposure to the sun, are
of the deepest brown that can be, without
approaching to black. As they stood singly
on the ramparts, or in groups at the gates,
their bronze faces and Roman helmets
seemed of a deeper hue, than the gloom,
that partly concealed their figures.</p>

<p>The entrance into Manheim, from the
Rhine, is by a spacious street, which leads
directly into the centre of the city, and to
a large square, planted with limes, consisting,
on one side, of public buildings, and,
on the other, of several noble houses, one of
which is the chief inn, called the <i>Cour
Palatine</i>. This is the first city in Germany,
that can answer, by its appearance, the expectations
of a foreigner, who has formed
them from books. Its aspect is truly that
of a capital and of the residence of a Court;
except that in the day-time a traveller may
be somewhat surprised at the fewness of
passengers and the small shew of traffic,
amidst such public buildings, and in streets
of such convenience and extent. The fairness,
the grandeur and the stateliness, which
he may have seen attributed to other German
cities, till he is as much disgusted as
deceived by every idea derived from description,
may be perceived in several parts
of Manheim, and the justness of disposition
in all.</p>

<p>Nor is the beauty of the present city
solely owing to the destruction of the antient
one by Louis the Fourteenth, in 1689,
the year of general devastation in the Palatinate.
It was laid out in right lines, though
to a less extent, in the beginning of the
seventeenth century, when Frederic the Fifth
laid the foundation of the fortifications, behind
which a town was built, that adopted
the antient name of Manheim, from a
neighbouring one then in decay. These
were the fortifications and the town destroyed
by the French in 1689. The plan
of both was but extended, when the present
works were formed upon the system
of Cohorn, and the city by degrees restored,
with streets, which, intersecting each other
at right angles, divide it into an hundred
and seven square portions. The number
of the inhabitants, exclusive of the garrison,
was, in 1784, 21,858.</p>

<p>Some of the streets are planted with rows
of trees, and there are five or six open
places, suitable for promenades, or markets.
The customhouse, which forms a side to
one of these, is a noble stone building,
rather appearing to be a palace, than an
office, except that under the colonnades,
which surround it, are shops for jewellery
and other commodities.</p>

<p>The Electoral palace, which opens, on
one side, to the city, and, on the other, to
the ramparts, was built by the Elector
Charles-Philippe, who, in the year 1721,
removed his residence hither from Heidelberg,
on account of some difference with
the magistrates, or, as is said, of the prevalence
of religious disputes in that city.
He began to erect it in 1720; but the edifice
was not completed, till the right wing
was added by the present Elector, not to be
used as a residence, but to contain a gallery
of paintings, cabinets of antiquities and natural
history, a library, treasury and <i>manege</i>.
We passed a morning in viewing the apartments
in the other wing, all the paintings
and books having been removed from this,
as well as great part of the furniture from
the whole palace, in the dread of an approaching
bombardment. The person, who
shewed them, took care to keep the credit
of each room safe, by assuring us at the
door, that it was not in its usual condition.
The Elector had been, for some months, at
Munich, but the Duke and Duchess of
Deux Ponts and their family have resided
in this palace, since their retirement from
Deux Ponts, in the latter end of the campaign
of 1792.</p>

<p>The rooms are all lofty, and floored with
inlaid work of oak and chesnut; the ceilings,
for the most part, painted; and the
walls covered with tapestry, finely wrought,
both as to colour and design. Some of
this came from a manufactory, established
by the Elector, at Franckenthal.</p>

<p>The furniture, left in several of the
rooms, was grand and antient, but could
never have been so costly as those, who
have seen the mansions of wealthy individuals
in England, would expect to find in
a palace. The Elector's state-bed was inclosed
not only by a railing, but by a glass
case to the height of the ceiling, with windows,
that could be opened at pleasure, to
permit a conversation with his courtiers,
when compliments were paid literally at a
levee. In the court of France, this practice
continued even to very late years, and there
were three distinct privileges of entr&eacute;e, denoting
the time, at which persons of different
classes were permitted to enter the
chamber. In the Earl of Portland's embassy
for King William to Louis the Fourteenth,
it was thought a signal mark of honour,
that he was admitted to his audience,
not only in the chamber, but within the
rails; and there the French Monarch stood
with the three young Princes, his grandsons,
the Count de Tholouse, the Duke
d'Aumont and the Mareschal de Noailles.
The Duke made his speech covered, after
which the King entered into conversation
with him, for several minutes.</p>

<p>One room, at Manheim, was called the
Silver Chamber, from the quantity of solid
silver, used about the furniture. Such articles
as could be carried away entire, had
been removed, but the walls were disfigured
by the loss of the ornaments torn from
them, on account of their value. In several
rooms, the furniture, that remained, was
partly packed, to be carried away upon the
next alarm. The contents of the wardrobe
were in this state, and the interior of these
now desolated apartments seemed like the
skeleton of grandeur. The beauty of the
painted ceilings, however, the richness of
the various prospects, commanded by the
windows, and the great extent of the building
sufficiently accounted for the reputation,
which this palace has, of being the finest in
Germany.</p>

<p>It is built of stone, which has somewhat
the reddish hue of that used at Mentz, and,
though several parts are positively disapproved
by persons of skill in architecture,
the whole is certainly a grand and sumptuous
building.</p>

<p>The situation of Manheim and the
scenery around it are viewed to great advantage
from the tower of the Observatory,
in which strangers are politely received by
the Professor of Astronomy, whose residence
is established in it. From this are seen the
fruitful plains of the Palatinate, spreading,
on all sides, to bold mountains, of which
those of Lorrain, that extend on the west,
lose in distance the variety of their colouring,
and, assuming a blue tint, retain only
the dignity of their form. Among these,
the vast and round headland, called the
<i>Tonnesberg</i>, which is in sight, during the
greatest part of the journey from Mentz to
Manheim, is pre-eminent.</p>

<p>But the chain, that binds the horizon on
the east, and is known by the name of the
<i>Bergstrasse</i>, or road of mountains, is near
enough to display all their wild irregularity
of shape, the forest glens, to which they
open, and the various tints of rock and soil,
of red and purple, that mingle with the
corn and wood on their lower steeps. These
mountains are seen in the north from their
commencement near Franckfort, and this
line is never interrupted from thence southward
into Switzerland. The rivals to them,
on the south west, are the mountains of
Alsace, which extend in long perspective,
and at a distance appear to unite with those
of the Bergstrasse. Among the numerous
towns and villages that throng the Palatinate,
the spires of Oppenheim and Worms
are distinctly visible to the north; almost
beneath the eye are those of Franckenthal,
and Oggersheim, and to the southward
Spires shews its many towers.</p>

<p>In the nearer scene the Neckar, after
tumbling from among the forests of the
Bergstrasse, falls into the Rhine, a little below
the walls of Manheim; and the gardens
of a summer chateau belonging to
the Elector occupy the angle between the
two rivers.</p>

<p>These gardens were now surrendered by
the Prince to be the camp of three thousand
of his troops, detached from the garrison of
the city, which, at this time, consisted of
nearly ten thousand men. In several places,
on the banks of the two rivers, batteries
were thrown up, and, near the camp, a
regular fort, for the purpose of commanding
both; so that Manheim, by its natural and
artificial means of defence, was supposed to
be rendered nearly unassailable, on two sides.
On that of Heidelberg, it was not so secure;
nor could the others be defended by
a garrison of less than 15,000 men. It was
on this account, that the Elector detained
ten thousand of his troops from actual service,
contrary, as is said, to the remonstrances
of the Emperor, who offered, but
without success, to garrison his capital with
Austrians. From the observatory, the camp
and the works were easily seen, and, by the
help of a Dollond telescope, the only optical
instrument remaining, the order of both
was so exactly pointed out by our guide,
that it was not difficult to comprehend the
uses of them. Military preparations, indeed,
occurred very frequently in Manheim.
In the gardens of the chief Electoral
palace, extending to the ramparts over the
Rhine, cannon were planted, which were
as regularly guarded by sentinels as in the
other parts of the fortifications.</p>

<p>All the gates of Manheim appear to be defended
by fortifications of unusual strength.
Besides two broad ditches, there are batteries,
which play directly upon the bridges,
and might destroy them in a few minutes.
The gates are guarded, with the utmost
strictness, and no person is suffered to enter
them, after ten at night, without the express
permission of the governor. When
a courier arrives, who wishes to use his privilege
of passing, at all hours, he puts some
token of his office into a small tin box,
which is kept on the outside of the ditch,
to be drawn across it by a cord, that runs
upon a roller on each bank. The officer of
the guard carries this to the governor, and
obtains the keys; but so much time is passed
in this sort of application, that couriers,
when the nights are short, usually wait the
opening of the gates, which is soon after
day-light, in summer, and at six, or seven,
in winter.</p>

<p>The absence of the Elector, we were
assured, had much altered the appearance of
Manheim, where scarcely a carriage was
now to be seen, though there were traces
enough of the gaiety and general splendour
of this little Court. Here are an Opera
House, a German Comedy, an Amateur
Concert, an Electoral Lottery, an Academy
of Sculpture and Design, and an Academy
of Sciences. The Opera performances are
held in a wing of the palace, and were
established in 1742, but have not attained
much celebrity, being supported chiefly by
performers from the other Theatre. This
last is called a national establishment, the
players being Germans, and the Theatre
founded in 1779 at the expence of the
Elector. The Baron de Dahlberg, one of
his Ministers, has the superintendance of
it. The Amateur Concert is held, every
Friday, during the winter, and is much frequented.</p>

<p>The Electoral Lotteries, for there are
two, are drawn in the presence of the Minister
of Finances, and one of them is less
disadvantageous for the gamesters than is
usual with such undertakings. That, which
consists of chances determined in the customary
way, gives the Elector an advantage
of only five to four over the subscribers.
The other, which is formed upon the more
intricate model of that of Genoa, entitles
the subscribers to prizes, proportioned to
the number of times a certain ticket issues
from the wheel, five numbers being drawn
out of ninety, or rather five drawings of
one number each being successively made
out of ninety tickets. A ticket, which issues
once in these five drawings, wins fifteen
times the value of the stake; one, that
should be drawn each of the five times,
would entitle the owner to have his original
stake multiplied by sixty thousand, and
the product would be his prize. The undertaker
of this latter Lottery has the
chances immensely in his favour.</p>

<p>From the very large income, to which
these Lotteries contribute a part, the present
Elector has certainly made considerable
disbursements, with useful purposes, if not to
useful effects. Of his foundation are the
Academy of Sciences, which was opened in
1763, for weekly sittings, and has proceeded
to some correspondence with other Academies;
the German Society, established
for the easy purpose of purifying and the
difficult one of fixing language; the Cabinet
of Physics, or rather of experimental
philosophy, celebrated for the variety and
magnitude of its instruments, among which
are two burning glasses of three feet diameter,
said to be capable of liquefying bodies,
even bottles filled with water, at 10 feet
distance; the Observatory, of 108 feet high,
in which all the chief instruments were
English; a Botanical Garden and Directorship;
an Academy of Sculpture, and a Cabinet
of Engravings and Drawings, formed
under the direction of M. Krahe of Dusseldorff,
in 400 folio volumes.</p>

<p>Of all these establishments, none of the
ornaments, or materials, that were portable,
now remain at Manheim. The astronomical
instruments, the celebrated collection of
statues, the paintings and the prints have
been removed, together with the Electoral
treasure of diamonds and jewels, some to
Munich and some to other places of security.
But, though we missed a sight, which
even its rarity would have rendered welcome,
it seems proper, after such frequent
notice of the barrenness of Germany, to
mention what has been collected in one of
its chief cities.</p>

<p>The expectation of an attack had dismantled
other houses, besides the Elector's,
of their furniture; for, in the Cour Palatine,
a very spacious, and really a good inn,
not a curtain and scarcely a spoon was left.
<i>A cause de la guerre</i> was, indeed, the general
excuse for every deficiency, used by
those, who had civility enough to offer one;
but, in truth, the war had not often
incroached upon the ordinary stock of conveniencies
in Germany, which was previously
too low to be capable of much reduction.
The places, which the French had actually
entered, are, of course, to be excepted; but
it may otherwise be believed, that Germany
can lose little by a war, more than the unfortunate
labourers, whom it forces to become
soldiers. The loss of wealth must
come chiefly from other countries. A rich
nation may give present treasure; a commercial
nation may give both present treasure
and the means of future competence.</p>

<p>The land near Manheim is chiefly planted
with tobacco and madder, and the landscape
is enlivened with small, but neat countryhouses,
scattered along the margin of the
Neckar. The neighbourhood abounds in
pleasant rides, and, whether you wind the
high banks of the majestic Rhine, or the
borders of the more tranquil Neckar, the
mountains of the Bergstrasse, tumbled upon
each other in wild confusion, generally
form the magnificent back ground of the
scene.</p>

<p>On returning from an excursion of this
kind at the close of evening, the soldiers
at the gates are frequently heard chanting
martial songs in parts and chorus; a sonorous
music in severe unison with the solemnity
of the hour and the imperfect
forms, that meet the eye, of sentinels keeping
watch beneath the dusky gateways,
while their brethren, reposing on the
benches without, mingle their voices in the
deep chorus. Rude and simple as are these
strains, they are often singularly impressive,
and touch the imagination with something
approaching to horror, when the circumstances
of the place are remembered, and it
is considered how soon these men, sent to
inflict death on others, may themselves be
thrown into the unnumbered heap of the
military slain.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="X-SCHWETZINGEN" id="X-SCHWETZINGEN">SCHWETZINGEN.</a></h3>

<p>An excellent road, sheltered for nine
English miles by rows of high poplars, conducted
us through richly cultivated plains
from Manheim to Schwetzingen, a small
village, distinguished by an Electoral chateau
and gardens. This was one of the
pleasantest rides we had found in Germany,
for the road, though it exhibited little of
either the wild or picturesque, frequently
opened towards the mountains, bright with
a variety of colouring, and then again was
shrouded among woods and plantations,
that bordered the neighbouring fields, and
brought faintly to remembrance the style
and mingled verdure of our native landscape.</p>

<p>Schwetzingen had been very lately the
Austrian head-quarters, for the army of the
Upper Rhine, and some soldiers were still
stationed near the road to guard an immense
magazine of wood; but there were otherwise
no military symptoms about the place.</p>

<p>The chateau is an old and inelegant
building, not large enough to have been
ever used as a formal residence. The present
Elector has added to it two wings, each
of six hundred feet long, but so low, that
the apartments are all on the ground floor.
Somewhat of that air of neglect, which can
sadden even the most delightful scenes, is
visible here; several of the windows are
broken, and the theatre, music-room, and
ball-room, which have been laid out in one
of the wings, are abandoned to dust and
lumber.</p>

<p>The gardens, however, are preserved in
better order. Before the palace, a long vista
of lawn and wood, with numerous and spacious
fountains, guarded by statues, display
something of the old French manner; other
parts shew charming scenery, and deep sylvan
recesses, where nature is again at liberty;
in a bay formed by the woods is an
amphitheatre of fragrant orange trees, placed
in front of a light semi-circular green-house,
and crowned with lofty groves. Near this
delicious spot, extends a bending arcade of
lattice-work, interwoven with vines and
many beautifully flowering plants; a sort of
structure, the filagree lightness of which it
is impossible not to admire, against precept,
and perhaps, when general effect is considered,
against necessary taste. In another
part, sheltered by the woods, is an edifice
in the style of a Turkish mosque, with its
light cloistered courts, slender minarets, and
painted entrances, inscribed with Arabic
mottos, which by the German translations
appear to express the pleasure of friendly
conversation and of indolence in summer.
The gardens have this result of a judicious
arrangement, that they seem to extend much
beyond their real limits, which we discovered
only by ascending one of the minarets.
They are open to the public, during great
part of every day, under certain rules for
their preservation, of which copies are
pasted up in several places.</p>

<p>At Schwetzingen the fine Electoral
road concludes, and we began to wind along
the skirts of a forest on the left, having on
the right an open corn country, beyond
which appeared the towers of Spires and
Philipsburg, of which the former was then
the head-quarters of the Austrian army, and
the latter is memorable for having given
birth to Melancthon in 1491. Waghausel
and Bruchsal are small posting places in this
route, at a village between which we had
another instance of the little attention paid
to travellers in Germany. At a small inn,
noxious with some fumigation used against
bugs, we were detained a quarter of an
hour, because the landlord, who had gone
out after our arrival, had not left word how
much we should pay, and the poor old woman,
who, without shoes or stockings,
attended us, was terrified when we talked
of leaving what was proper, and proceeding
before his return.</p>

<p>About a mile beyond Bruchsal our postillion
quitted the chauss&eacute;e, and entered a
summer road, through the deep and extensive
forest of Carlsruhe, preserved by the
Margrave of Baden for the shelter of game.
Avenues cut through this forest for nine
or ten miles in every direction, converge
at his palace and city of Carlsruhe, as at a
point. Other cruelties than those of the
chase sometimes take place in these delightful
scenes, for an amphitheatre has been
formed in the woods, where imitations of a
Spanish bull feast have been exhibited; to
such horrid means of preventing vacuity of
mind has a prince had recourse, who is
otherwise distinguished for the elegance of
his taste, and the suavity of his manners!</p>

<p>The scenery of this forest is very various.
Sometimes we found our way through
groves of ancient pine and fir, so thickly
planted that their lower branches were
withered for want of air, and it seemed as
if the carriage could not proceed between
them; at others we passed under the spreading
shade of chesnuts, oak and walnut, and
crossed many a cool stream, green with the
impending foliage, on whose sequestered
bank one almost expected to see the moralizing
Jacques; so exactly did the scene
accord with Shakespeare's description. The
woods again opening, we found ourselves
in a noble avenue, and saw the stag gracefully
bounding across it "to more profound
repose;" while now and then a hut, formed
of rude green planks under some old oak,
seemed, by its smoked sides, to have often
afforded a sheltered repast to hunting
parties.</p>

<p>Near Carlsruhe the gardens of the Prince
and then the palace become visible, the
road winding along them, on the edge of
the forest, till it enters the northern gate of
the city, the uniformity of which has the
same date as its completion, the ground plot
having been entirely laid out between January
and June 1715, on the 17th of which
month the Margrave Charles William laid
the foundation stone.</p>

<p>The streets are accordingly spacious, light,
and exactly straight; but not so magnificent
as those of Manheim, and still less enlivened
with passengers. Since the commencement
of the war, the gaieties of the Court, which
afforded some occupation to the inhabitants,
have ceased; the nobility have left their
houses; and the Margrave is contented
with the amusements of his library, in
which English literature is said to fill a considerable
space.</p>

<p>Carlsruhe has the advantage of not being
fortified; so that the inhabitants are not
oppressed by a numerous garrison, and
strangers pass through it, though so near
the seat of war, without interruption. It
is less than Manheim by at least half, and
has no considerable public building, except
the palace, from the spacious area before
which, all the streets proceed as <i>radii</i>, till
their furthest ends fill up the figure of a
semicircle. The houses in the area, which
immediately front the palace, are built over
a piazza interrupted only by the commencement
of the streets. The palace has, of
course, an unexampled advantage in the
mixture of town and rural scenery in its
prospects, looking on one side through all
the streets of the city, and on the other
through thirty-two forest alleys, cut to
various lengths of from ten to fifteen English
miles each; few, however, of the latter prospects
are now commanded except from the
upper windows, the present Elector having
entirely changed the style of the intervening
gardens, and permitted them to be laid out
in the English taste, without respect to the
thirty-two intersections, that rendered them
conformable with the forest.</p>

<p>We passed part of two days at Carlsruhe,
and were chiefly in these gardens, which
are of the most enchanting beauty and richness.
The warmth of the climate draws
up colours for the shrubs and plants, which
we thought could not be equalled in more
northern latitudes; two thousand and seven
hundred orange and lemon trees, loaded
with fruit and blossoms, perfumed the air;
and choice shrubs, marked with the Linnean
distinctions, composed the thickets.
The gardens, being limited only by the forests,
appear to unite with them; and the
deep verdure and luxuriance of the latter
are contrasted sweetly with the tender green
of the lawns and plants, and with the variety
of scarce and majestic trees, mingled
with the garden groves.</p>

<p>The palace is a large and sumptuous,
though not an elegant edifice, built of stone
like all the rest of the city, and at the same
period. The Margrave generally resides in
it, and has rendered it a valuable home, by
adding greatly to the library, filling an
observatory with excellent instruments, and
preserving the whole structure in a condition
not usual in Germany. The spot,
compared with the surrounding country,
appeared like Milton's Eden&mdash;like Paradise
opened in the wild.</p>

<p>Beyond Carlsruhe the road begins to approach
the Rhine, which we had lost sight
of near Manheim; and, though the river is
never within view, the country is considered
as a military frontier, being constantly
patrolled by troops. Some of these were of
the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s army of emigrants,
who have no uniform, and are distinguished
only by the white cockade, and by a bandage
of white linen, impressed with black
<i>fleurs de lis</i>, upon the right arm. They
were chiefly on foot, and then wore only
their swords, without fire-arms.</p>

<p>Near the road, a small party of Austrians
were guarding a magazine, before a tent,
marked, like their regimentals, with green
upon white. Soon afterwards, our postillion
drew up on one side, to permit a train
of carriages to pass, and immediately announced
the <i>Prinz von Cond&eacute;</i>, who was in
an open landau, followed by two covered
waggons for his kitchen and laundry, and
by a coach with attendants.</p>

<p>He appeared to be between fifty and
sixty; tall, not corpulent, and of an air,
which might have announced the French
courtier, if his rank had been unknown.
A star was embroidered upon his military
surtout, but he had no guards, though travelling
within the jurisdiction allotted to
him as a general officer. So little was the
road frequented at this period, that his was
the second or third carriage we had met,
except military waggons, since leaving
Mentz; a distance of more than eighty English
miles.</p>

<p>The road for the whole stage between
Carlsruhe and Rastadt, about fifteen miles,
is planted, as seems customary in Germany
between the palaces of sovereigns, with lofty
trees, of which the shade was extremely
refreshing at this season; the clouds of
sand, that rose from the road, would otherwise
have made the heat intolerable.</p>

<p>The first house in Rastadt is the palace of
the Margrave of Baden Baden, brother of
the Margrave of Baden Durlach, whose residence
is at Carlsruhe, a small and heavy
building, that fronts the avenue, and is
surrounded with stone walls. The interior
is said to be splendidly decorated, and a
chamber is preserved in the state, in which
Prince Eugene and Marshal Villars left it
in 1714, after concluding the peace between
the Emperor and Louis the Fourteenth.
The Prince of Baden, being then a general
in the service of the Emperor, had not been
able to escape the vengeance of Louis,
whose troops in 1688 first plundered, and
then burnt, the palace and city, and in the
war of the Succession they had a camp on
the adjoining plain. The Prince is therefore
supposed to have lent the palace, which
he had rebuilt, with the more readiness,
that the Marshal might see how perfectly
he could overcome his loss. The plunder of
the city in 1688 had continued for five
days, and it is mentioned in its history that
the French carried away fifteen waggon
loads of wine of the vintage of 1572.</p>

<p>Rastadt, like Carlsruhe, is built upon one
plan, but is as inferior to it in beauty, as
in size. The chief street is, however, uncommonly
broad, so much so, that the upper
end is used as a market-place, and the
statue of the founder, Prince Louis, in the
centre, is seen with all the advantages of
space and perspective. There is, notwithstanding,
little appearance of traffic, and the
inhabitants seemed to be much less numerous
than the emigrant corps, which was
then stationed there, the head quarters of
the Prince of Cond&eacute; being established in the
city. We passed an hour at an inn, which
was nearly filled by part of this corps,
and were compelled to witness the distress
and disappointment, excited by intelligence
just then received of the state of affairs in
the Low Countries.</p>

<p>A small park of artillery was kept on
the southern side of Rastadt, where there
is a handsome stone bridge over the river
Murg, that falls into the Rhine, at the
distance of a league from the city. Soon after,
the road passes by the groves of the <i>Favorita</i>,
a summer palace built by a dowager
Margravine. We now drew nearer to the
mountains of the Bergstrasse, which had
disappeared near Schwetzingen, and had
risen again partially through the morning
mists, soon after our quitting Carlsruhe.
They are here of more awful height, and
abrupt steepness than in the neighbourhood
of Manheim, and, on their pointed brows,
are frequently the ruins of castles, placed
sometimes where it seems as if no human
foot could climb. The nearer we approached
these mountains the more we had occasion
to admire the various tints of their granites.
Sometimes the precipices were of a
faint pink, then of a deep red, a dull purple,
or a blush approaching to lilac, and sometimes
gleams of a pale yellow mingled with
the low shrubs, that grew upon their sides.
The day was cloudless and bright, and we
were too near these heights to be deceived
by the illusions of a&euml;rial colouring; the real
hues of their features were as beautiful, as
their magnitude was sublime. The plains,
that extend along their feet to the Rhine,
are richly cultivated with corn, and, beyond
the river, others, which appear to be equally
fruitful, spread towards the mountains of
Alsace, a corresponding chain with the Bergstrasse,
vast and now blue with distance.</p>

<p>The manners of the people from Manheim
downwards, are more civilized than in
the upper parts of Germany; an improvement,
which may with great probability be
imputed to the superior fruitfulness of the
country, that amends their condition, and
with it the social qualities. The farms are
more numerous, the labourers less dejected,
and the women, who still work barefooted
in the fields, have somewhat of a ruddy
brown in their complexion, instead of the
sallowness, that renders the ferocious, or
sullen air of the others more striking. They
are also better dressed; for, though they retain
the slouched woollen hat, they have
caps; and towards the borders of Switzerland
their appearance becomes picturesque.
Here they frequently wear a blue petticoat
with a cherry-coloured boddice, full white
sleeves fastened above the elbow, and a
muslin handkerchief thrown gracefully
round the neck in a sort of roll; the hair
sometimes platted round the head, and held
on the crown with a large bodkin. On
holidays, the girls have often a flat straw
hat, with bows of ribband hanging behind.
Higher up, the women wear their long black
hair platted, but falling in a queue down
the back.</p>

<p>The cottages are also somewhat better,
and the sides entirely covered with vines,
on which, in the beginning of July, were
grapes bigger than capers, and in immense
quantities. Sometimes Turkey corn is put
to dry under the projections of the first
floor, and the gardens are ornamented with
a short alley of hops. Meat is however bad
and scarce; the appearance so disgusting
before it is dressed, that those, who can accommodate
their palates to the cooking,
must endeavour to forget what they have
seen. Butter is still more scarce, and the
little cheese that appears, is only a new
white curd, made up in rolls, scarcely bigger
than an egg. A sort of beer is here made
for servants, the taste of which affords no
symptom of either malt or hops; it is often
nearly white, and appears to have been
brewed but a few hours; what is somewhat
browner is bottled, and sold at about threepence
a quart.</p>

<p>Our road, this day, was seldom more
than two leagues distant from the Rhine,
and we expected to have heard the fire,
which the Austrian and French posts, who
have their batteries on the two banks of the
river, frequently exchange with each other.
The tranquillity was, however, as sound as
in any other country, and nothing but the
continuance of patroles and convoys reminded
us of our nearness to the war. The
peasants were as leisurely cutting their harvest,
and all the other business of rural life
was proceeding as uninterruptedly, as if
there was no possibility of an attack. Yet
we afterwards learned, that the French had,
very early on the morning of this day, ineffectually
attempted the passage of the
Rhine, about fifteen miles higher up; and
the firing had been distinctly heard at a
little village where we dined.</p>

<p>One road, as short as this, lies immediately
upon the margin of the river; and,
as we were assured that none but military
parties were fired at, we wished to pass it,
for the purpose of observing the ingenious
methods, by which a country so circumstanced
is defended; but our postillion, who
dreaded, that he might be pressed by the
Austrians, for the intrusion, refused to venture
upon it, and, instead of proceeding to
Kehl, which is directly opposite to Strasbourg,
we took the road for Offenburg,
about three leagues from the Rhine.</p>

<p>The country through which our route
now lay, better as it is than more northern
parts, has suffered some positive injuries by
the war. Before this, all the little towns,
from Carlsruhe downwards, maintained
some commerce with France, on their own
account, and supplied carriage for that of
others. In return for provisions and coarse
commodities for manufacture, carried to
Strasbourg, they received the silks and
woollens of France, to be dispersed at
Franckfort, or Manheim. The intercourse
between the two countries was so frequent,
that nearly all the tradesmen, and many of
the labouring persons in this part of Germany
speak a little French. The landlord
of the house, where we dined, assured us
that, though his village was so small, he had
sufficient business before the war; now he
was upon the point of removing to Offenburg,
being unable to pay his rent, during
the interruption of travelling.</p>

<p>A little before sun-set, we came to Appenweyer,
one of these towns, from the
entrance of which the spires of Strasbourg
were so plainly visible that we could see the
fanes glittering against the light, and even
the forms of the fortifications near the water
could be traced. In the midst of the
straggling town of Appenweyer the loud
sounds of martial music and then the appearance
of troops, entering at the opposite
end, surprised us. This was the advanced
guard of several Austrian regiments, on
their march to re-inforce the allied army
in the Low Countries. Our postillion had
drawn up, to surrender as much of the road
as possible to them, but their march was so
irregular, that they frequently thronged
round the carriage; affording us sufficient
opportunity to observe how far their air
corresponded with what has been so often
said of the Austrian soldiery.</p>

<p>Except as to their dress and arms, their
appearance is not military, according to any
notion, which an Englishman is likely to
have formed; that is, there is nothing of
activity, nothing of spirit, of cheerfulness,
of the correctness of discipline, or of the
eagerness of the youthful in it. There is
much of ferocity, much of timid cruelty,
of sullenness, indolence and awkwardness.
They dress up their faces with mustachios,
and seem extremely desirous to impress terror.
How far this may be effectual against
other troops we cannot know; but they
certainly are, by their ferocious manners,
and by the traits, which a nearer view of
them discloses, very terrible to the peaceful
traveller. Though now immediately under
the eyes of their officers they could scarcely
refrain from petty insults, and from wishfully
laying their hands upon our baggage.</p>

<p>About a thousand men passed in two
divisions, which had commenced their
march a few hours before, for the purpose
of avoiding the heat of the day. As we
proceeded, the trodden corn in the fields
shewed where they had rested.</p>

<p>It was night before we reached Offenburg,
where we were compelled to lodge
at a wretched inn called the Post-house,
the master of the other having that day
removed to admit a new tenant; but the
condition of the lodging was of little importance,
for, all night, the heavy trampling
of feet along the road below prevented
sleep, and with the first dawn the sound of
martial music drew us to the windows. It
seemed like a dream, when the Austrian
bands played <i>&ccedil;a ira</i>, with double drums,
and cymbals thrown almost up to our
casements, louder than any we had ever heard
before. This was the main body of the
army, of which we had met the advanced
party. Each regiment was followed by a
long train of baggage carriages, of various
and curious descriptions, some of the cabriolets
having a woman nearly in man's
apparel in the front, and behind, a large
basket higher than the carriage, filled with
hay. This "tide of human existence" continued
to pass for several hours. But the
whole army did not consist of more than
three regiments of infantry, among which
were those of D'Arcy, and Pellegrini, and
one of horse; for each of the Austrian regiments
of foot contains, when complete, two
thousand three hundred men. They had
with them a small train of artillery, and
were to proceed to the Low Countries as
quick as they could march; but, so uniform
are the expedients of the councils of Vienna,
that the opportunity of carrying these
troops down the Rhine in barges from
Phillipsburg, where it was practicable, was
not adopted, though this method would
have saved two weeks out of three, and
have landed the army unfatigued at its
post.</p>

<p>All their regimentals were white, faced
either with light blue, or pompadour, and
seemed unsuitably delicate for figures so
large and heavy. The cavalry were loaded
with many articles of baggage, but their
horses appeared to be of the strongest and
most serviceable kind. This was a grand
military show, which it was impossible to
see without many reflections on human
nature and human misery.</p>

<p>Offenburg is a small town, in the Margraviate
of Baden Baden, pleasantly seated
at the feet of the Bergstrasse, which the road
again approaches so near as to be somewhat
obstructed by its acclivities. Our way lay
along the base of these steeps, during the
whole day; and as we drew nearer to Switzerland,
their height became still more stupendous,
and the mountains of Alsace seemed
advancing to meet them in the long perspective;
the plains between, through which
the Rhine gleamed in long sweeps, appeared
to be entirely covered with corn, and in
the nearer scene joyous groups were loading
the waggons with the harvest. An harvest
of another kind was ripening among the
lower rocks of the Bergstrasse, where the
light green of the vines enlivened every
cliff, and sometimes overspread the ruinous
walls of what had once been fortresses.</p>

<p>We passed many villages, shaded with
noble trees, which had more appearance of
comfort than any we had seen, and which
were enviable for the pleasantness of their
situation; their spacious street generally
opening to the grandeur of the mountain
vista, that extended to the south. In these
landscapes the peasant girl, in the simple
dress of the country, and balancing on her
large straw hat an harvest keg, was a very
picturesque figure.</p>

<p>It was evening when we came within
view of Friburg, the last city of Germany
on the borders of Switzerland, and found
ourselves among mountains, which partook
of the immensity and sublimity of those of
that enchanting country. But what was
our emotion, when, from an eminence, we
discovered the pointed summits of what we
believed to be the Swiss mountains themselves,
a multitudinous assemblage rolled in
the far-distant prospect! This glimpse of a
country of all others in Europe the most
astonishing and grand, awakened a thousand
interesting recollections and delightful expectations;
while we watched with regret
even this partial vision vanishing from our
eyes as we descended towards Friburg.
The mountains, that encompass this city,
have so much the character of the great,
that we immediately recollect the line of
separation between Germany and Switzerland
to be merely artificial, not marked
even by a river. Yet while we yield to the
awful pleasure which this eternal vastness
inspires, we feel the insignificance of our
temporary nature, and, seeming more than
ever conscious by what a slender system our
existence is upheld, somewhat of dejection
and anxiety mingle with our admiration.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
